This article unpacks the key requirements and provides actionable strategies for compliance.</p>
      <p><a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/risk-management">Risk management</a> is a significant component of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/745/oj/eng">EU MDR 2017/745</a> and is vital to ensure the safety of patients and medical device users. A thorough approach to risk management activities is essential for medical device manufacturers to demonstrate conformity with the requirements of the EU MDR. In this article, we will explore the requirements placed on medical device manufacturers by the EU MDR and provide an overview on how to address them.</p>
      <h2 id="what-are-the-requirements">What are the requirements?</h2>
      <p>Article 10, point 2 of the EU MDR stipulates that manufacturers are required to establish, document, implement and maintain a system for risk management. It can therefore be clearly interpreted that risk management must be an ongoing process throughout the lifecycle of a device, rather than a ‘one-off’ exercise. A continuous approach to risk management is pivotal in ensuring compliance with regulatory complaints and, moreover, safeguarding patients and device users from avoidable harm.</p>
      <p>A more detailed breakdown of risk management requirements can be found in Annex I, points 2-8 of the EU MDR. In summary, the points stipulate that manufacturers must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduce risks as far as possible without negatively affecting the benefit/risk profile of a device.</li>
        <li>Establish, document, implement and maintain a risk management system throughout the entire lifecycle of a device. This process includes:
          <ul>
            <li>Development of a risk management plan</li>
            <li>Identification of known and foreseeable hazards associated with the device</li>
            <li>Evaluation of risks associated with the device during intended and reasonably foreseeable misuse</li>
            <li>Implementation of measures to control or eliminate identified risks</li>
            <li>Incorporation of information gathered during device production and <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/post-market-surveillance-pms">post-market surveillance (PMS)</a> regarding the frequency of identified risks</li>
            <li>Implementation/amendment of risk control measures to address new risks, or risks with greater frequency than initially forecast, based on information obtained through PMS activities.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Manage risks to an extent that the residual risk associated with each hazard, and the overall residual risk of a device, is acceptable.</li>
        <li>Inform users of any residual risks</li>
        <li>Reduce or eliminate risks relating to user error</li>
        <li>Ensure that the safety of patients and device users is not affected by the impact of stresses and environmental factors on device performance under normal conditions of use throughout the lifetime of the device.</li>
        <li>Design, manufacture and package devices in a manner that ensures their characteristics and performance are not affected during storage and transport.</li>
        <li>Ensure that all foreseeable risks and undesirable side effects are reduced as far as possible and deemed acceptable when weighed against the benefit of a device to patients and users.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Annex I, point 9 refers to the requirement for devices without an intended medical purpose, as outlined in Annex XVI, to present no risk at all or a risk that is no greater than the maximum acceptable risk related to the device’s use. Interpretation of this statement would infer that, for devices without an intended medical purpose that remain governed by MDR, the level of acceptable risk is minimal. Devices falling under this bracket include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contact lenses and other products intended to be introduced onto or into the eye</li>
        <li>Products intended to be totally or partially inserted into the body through surgically invasive means for modifying anatomy or the fixation of body parts, excluding tattooing products and piercings</li>
        <li>Facial, dermal or mucous membrane fillers</li>
        <li>Equipment for the destruction, reduction of removal of adipose tissue, such as those used in liposuction and lipolysis</li>
        <li>Equipment emitting high-intensity electromagnetic radiation for use on the human body, such as lasers and pulsed light equipment used in skin resurfacing, tattoo or hair removal</li>
        <li>Equipment intended to modify neuronal activity in the brain by applying electrical currents or magnetic or electromagnetic fields that penetrate the cranium</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="how-do-we-meet-the-requirements">How do we meet the requirements?</h2>
      <p>One approach to meeting the requirements for risk management is to align risk management procedures with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/quick-guide-iso-14971-risk-management-mantrasystems-xwtne/">BS EN ISO 14971</a>, since the standard is aligned with the General Safety and Performance Requirements of the EU MDR.</p>
      <p>BS EN ISO 14971 describes 6 distinct steps in the overall risk management process, as demonstrated below:</p>

        <figcaption>A risk management process</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h2 id="risk-management-plan">Risk Management Plan</h2>
      <p>It is essential that all activities conducted during risk management are planned and that this plan is documented. A robust risk management plan will describe the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assignment of responsibilities and authorities for risk management processes.</li>
        <li>A roadmap for risk management activities to be conducted, based on the 6 defined process steps in BS EN ISO 14971.</li>
        <li>A procedure for the identification and analysis of risks associated with the device throughout its lifetime.</li>
        <li>Criteria for determination of risk acceptability.</li>
        <li>A procedure for the identification and implementation of appropriate risk control measures.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A procedure for the evaluation of individual and overall residual risks following the implementation of risk control measures.</p>
      <p>A process for the collection and review of production and post-production information.</p>
      <h2 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h2>
      <p>Risk assessment involves the analysis of risks by identifying all relevant hazards, hazardous situations and harms, and estimating the probability and severity of identified risks. In order to provide a framework for the identification of risks, it is beneficial to consider the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Definition of intended use:
          <ul>
            <li>Intended medical indication and target medical condition</li>
            <li>Target patient population
              <ul>
                <li>Demographics</li>
                <li>Disease state and stage</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Part of body/type of tissue the device interacts with</li>
            <li>Device user profile
              <ul>
                <li>Age</li>
                <li>Medical professionals and/or laypersons</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Use environment</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Definition of reasonably foreseeable misuse:
          <ul>
            <li>Accidental use error</li>
            <li>Use under the wrong conditions</li>
            <li>Impact of intentional misuse</li>
            <li>Use for non-intended clinical indications</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Characteristics related to safety</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A comprehensive list of hazards, hazardous situations and associated harms can be identified following the definition of intended use, reasonably foreseeable misuse and characteristics related to safety. According to the definitions in BS EN ISO 14971, a hazard cannot result in harm until a sequence of events or circumstances (including normal use and reasonably foreseeable misuse) leads to a hazardous situation. Each hazard (e.g. device size too small) can be associated with several hazardous situations (e.g. pressure of device against skin), each associated with several potential harms (e.g. skin abrasion). Once a risk has been followed through from hazard to harm, it can be assessed by estimating both severity and probability of occurrence of harm that could result. A pre-determined criteria of risk acceptability, as documented in the risk management plan, can then be applied based on the estimated risk probability and severity.</p>
      <h2 id="risk-control">Risk control</h2>
      <p>The application of appropriate risk control measures to reduce the probability and/or severity of each identified potential harm, regardless of initial evaluation of acceptability, is required. This process ensures that each identified risk has been reduced as far as possible, without negatively affecting the overall benefit-risk profile of the device.</p>
      <p><a href="/enable-ce-mark/online-video-training-courses/risk-management">BS EN ISO 14971</a> sets out 3 broad risk control options for medical device manufacturers, in descending order of effectiveness, as described below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Elimination of risk through design of the device. Examples include:
          <ul>
            <li>Design without sharp edges</li>
            <li>Make dangerous electrical equipment inaccessible</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Reduction of risk through the addition of protective measures in the medical device itself or in the manufacturing process. Examples include:
          <ul>
            <li>Alarms</li>
            <li>Protective covers</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Reduction of risk through the provision of information for the safety of device users/operators. Examples include:
          <ul>
            <li>Warnings/precautions</li>
            <li>Promotion of use of protective equipment</li>
            <li>Instructions for use</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="evaluation-of-residual-risk">Evaluation of Residual Risk</h2>
      <p>Following the implementation of control measures to each identified risk, the probability and severity of each individual risk can be re-estimated, and the previously documented risk acceptability criteria re-applied to determine individual residual risks.</p>
      <p>Risk management requirements under the EU MDR place an onus on manufacturers to also assess overall residual risk, whereby the acceptability of all residual risks taken together must be determined.  As is the case when determining the acceptability of individual risks, a pre-determined criteria of acceptability must be documented and followed when evaluating overall residual risk. The assessment of overall residual risk should consider the distribution of individual residual risks by acceptability category. For example, even in the absence of any unacceptable individual risks, if a significant proportion of individual risks are considered ‘borderline’ the overall residual risk associated with a device may be deemed unacceptable. If this is the case, manufacturers must implement additional risk control measures, consider modifying the device design and manufacturing process, or place restrictions on the intended use or users, before re-evaluating individual and overall residual risks.</p>
      <p>Manufacturers are required to disclose any significant residual risks by providing relevant information in the device labelling and Instructions for Use documentation. The disclosure of residual risks should not be confused with information for safety, which forms part of the risk control process. The disclosure of residual risk does not in itself provide information which can reduce the probability or severity of a given risk, instead providing users with an overview of the risks associated with a device that remain after risk control measures have been implemented. Further guidance on the disclosure of residual risk, and information for safety, can be found in ISO/TR 24971.</p>
      <h2 id="risk-management-review">Risk Management Review</h2>
      <p>Once all the risk management activities described above have completed, manufacturers are required to conduct a risk management review. The review must assess whether all procedures in the Risk Management Plan were adhered to and a robust conclusion that the overall residual risk of the device is acceptable must be made. Finally, practices for the collection and assessment of production and post-production information relating to the risk of the device must be decided on and documented. The processes and conclusions of the risk management review must be documented in a Risk Management Report.</p>
      <h2 id="production-and-post-production-activities">Production and Post-Production Activities</h2>
      <p>BS EN ISO 14971 describes the requirement for manufacturers to implement, document and maintain a system to collect and analyse information relating to the safety of a medical device during its production and post-production phases.</p>
      <p>The collection of relevant information should encompass feedback and data from a variety of sources, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Information from the supply chain relating to production and distribution of the device.</li>
        <li>Information gathered during the production process.</li>
        <li>Information from those responsible for installation and maintenance of the device.</li>
        <li>Information from users of the device.</li>
        <li>Information relating to the device or similar devices which is publicly available.</li>
        <li>Information regarding updates to the state of the art.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When the relevant information has been collected, it must be subject to a formal review, with a focus on relevance of the information to the safety of the subject device. The review should identify the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Any hazards or hazardous situations that were not addressed during initial risk management procedures.</li>
        <li>Previously addressed hazardous situations which have become unacceptable due to the impact of collected information.</li>
        <li>If the overall residual risk remains acceptable or is now unacceptable.</li>
        <li>Updates to the acknowledged state of the art which may impact the safety profile of the device.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Following a review of information gathered during production and post-production activities, manufacturers must determine whether any action is required. This process should include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Review of the risk management file and reassessment of previously identified risks for appropriateness of the estimated severity and probability.</li>
        <li>Evaluation of new identified risks with a determination of risk acceptability, implementation of risk control measures and assessment of residual risk as previously carried out.</li>
        <li>Reassessment of overall residual risk of the device.</li>
        <li>Determination of whether actions related to already marketed devices, such as device recall, are required based on new information.</li>
        <li>Evaluation of the impact of new information on previous risk management activities.</li>
        <li>A determination of the suitability of risk management procedures by top management.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The EU MDR places significant risk management requirements on manufacturers of all medical devices. In order to demonstrate compliance, a detailed, well-documented. procedure-driven approach to all aspects of risk management must be implemented. In addition, risk management procedures must be viewed as an ongoing process throughout the lifetime of a device, rather than a one-off exercise.</p>
      <p>Though risk management compliance may seem daunting for manufacturers, embracing the requirements is an opportunity for manufacturers to support the safety of their device, and to utilise the data gathered to adopt a strong position in the market.</p>

    <p>As software advancements continue, the line between traditional hardware-centric medical devices and software-driven solutions becomes increasingly blurred. Enter the domains of Software in a Medical Device (SiMD), referring to software that is integral to the functioning of a physical medical device, and <a href="/solutions/regulatory-consulting-for-samd-software-as-a-medical-device">Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)</a>, which operates independently to perform medical functions. These two, while closely linked, serve as distinctive categories in the medical technology landscape.</p>
    <h2 id="software-as-a-medical-device-samd">Software <em>as a</em> Medical Device (SaMD)</h2>
    <p>Software as a medical device is defined by the <a href="https://www.imdrf.org/sites/default/files/docs/imdrf/final/technical/imdrf-tech-131209-samd-key-definitions-140901.pdf">International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF)</a> as:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>“<em>software intended to be used for one or more medical purposes that perform these purposes without being part of a hardware medical device.</em>”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Although this definition offers guidance on what falls under the term SaMD, it’s possible there could still be confusion regarding what constitutes a SaMD product, as applications can integrate with hardware devices without being part of them.</p>
    <p>Examples Include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An app that calculates appropriate insulin dosage based on a person’s blood glucose levels.</li>
      <li>Software that draws data from other digital devices to determine risk factors associated with epileptic seizures</li>
      <li>Software that uses artificial intelligence to look at MRI images to identify anomalies missed by other diagnostic tools (like an electrocardiogram)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="software-in-a-medical-device-simd">Software <em>in a</em> Medical Device (SiMD)</h2>
    <p>According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), SiMD refers to software that is incorporated into a medical device to control its performance or provide specific functions. SiMD is also known as embedded software, firmware, or microcode. Unlike SaMD, SiMD can’t function independently, and is instead reliant on the associated medical hardware. Since the software contributes to the device’s intended purpose, any malfunction or failure could impact the safety and performance of the entire medical device.</p>
    <p>Examples Include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Software embedded in a pacemaker, or defibrillator that monitors heart rhythm, calculates responses, and delivers electrical impulses</li>
      <li>Software that powers infusion pumps, glucose meters, and smart pens</li>
      <li>A mobile application that is the primary interface for reading continuous waveform data from an implanted or wearable EKG loop monitor</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="mdr-in-focus-how-it-applies-to-samd-and-simd">MDR in Focus: How it applies to SaMD and SiMD</h2>
    <h3 id="samd">SaMD</h3>
    <p>SaMD is classified under the MDR using a risk-based approach, aligning with its potential impact on patient health and safety. Risk classification is determined based on the level of risk posed to patients, similar to traditional medical devices. SaMD must undergo a conformity assessment in accordance with its risk classification. Higher-risk SaMD oftent require Notified Body (NB) involvement for certification, whereas lower-risk software (e.g., Class I) may only require self-certification.</p>
    <p>SaMD classification follows MDR Annex VIII, Rule 11:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Class I:</strong> Low-risk software, such as apps for general health tracking.</li>
      <li><strong>Class IIa:</strong> Medium-risk software that supports decision-making for non-critical conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Class IIb:</strong> Higher-risk software, such as diagnostic tools that influence significant treatment decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Class III:</strong> High-risk software used in critical or life-threatening situations, such as applications for surgical planning or cancer treatment.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="simd">SiMD</h3>
    <p>SiMD classification differs from SaMD and is typically evaluated within the regulatory framework of the overall medical device it accompanies. As a result, its risk classification is influenced by the combined risk of both the software and the device’s hardware. Consequently, SiMD must undergo a conformity assessment of the entire device. This means that even if the software alone is low risk, it must still meet the same regulatory scrutiny as the physical device, which may require NB involvement depending on the device classification.</p>
    <p>Despite their differences, Both SaMD and SiMD require rigorous clinical evaluation, risk management, and post-market monitoring, but the MDR treats them distinctly based on how they are used in medical practice.</p>
    <h2 id="unpacking-the-divide-samd-vs-simd">Unpacking the Divide: SaMD vs. SiMD</h2>
    <p>Overall, there are a few differences in the safety and efficacy standards that apply to SaMD and SiMD. Compliance around <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/38421.html">IEC 62304</a> (which outlines requirements for the safe design and maintenance of medical device software throughout its lifecycle), <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/63179.html">IEC 62366</a> (which focuses on usability engineering to ensure medical devices are safe and effective for users), and <a href="https://www.mantrasystems.co.uk/enable-ce-mark/online-video-training-courses/risk-management">ISO 14971</a> (which provides a framework for identifying, evaluating, and mitigating risks associated with medical devices) are the same.</p>
    <p>For example, both SaMD and SiMD must be classified according to IEC 62304 as far as class A, B, and C software where A is low-risk software and C is high-risk software. However, SiMD also has to meet additional requirements that concern hardware, and hardware and software integration. Compliance with these regulations ensures the safety and performance of the integrated software as part of the overall medical device.</p>
    <h2 id="navigating-the-nuances-final-takeaways-on-samd-vs-simd">Navigating the Nuances: Final Takeaways on SaMD vs. SiMD</h2>
    <p>The rise of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mantrasystems_regulatory-consulting-for-software-as-a-medical-activity-7295456626759614464-z-AN">SaMD</a> and SiMD highlights a significant shift in healthcare toward more personalised, accessible, and data-driven care. It reflects the remarkable progress in integrating technology with health while underscoring the critical responsibility to ensure these innovations prioritise patient safety.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, as we continue to explore the evolving landscape of SaMD and SiMD, understanding their complexities and distinctions is more important than ever. As the boundaries between software and medical devices become increasingly intertwined, our focus must remain steadfast on developing safe, effective, and forward-thinking solutions that enhance patient outcomes.</p>

  <p>Key points to note:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Notified Bodies are not required to change the date on the individual certificates</li>
    <li>The above dates are subject to meeting the relevant conditions under EU IVDR Article 110(3c)</li>
    <li>If your device is being placed on both the GB and NI markets, you should upload a single declaration confirming that the Article 110 extended CE certificate validity applies to both markets.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="extended-validity-in-the-uk">Extended validity in the UK</h2>
  <p>The MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/registration-of-in-vitro-diagnostic-devices-with-expiring-ce-certificates/registration-of-certain-in-vitro-diagnostic-devices">has issued new guidance on the impact of these new deadlines on the UK</a>.</p>
  <h3 id="great-britain-gb--england-wales-and-scotland">Great Britain (GB) – England, Wales, and Scotland</h3>
  <p>To support the safe supply of medical devices to GB and make the transition to the new regulatory framework smoother, the government has put in place legislation that extends the acceptance of CE-marked IVD devices. This means that CE-marked IVD devices, whether compliant with the EU IVDD or the EU IVDR, can continue to be placed on the GB market until the 30th June 2030 (or until the certificate expires).</p>
  <p>This is great news because it allows certain devices to stay on the market longer. However, there’s a key limitation: general IVD devices that were previously not required to involve a Notified Body under the EU IVDD will only be allowed on the GB market if they are upclassified (meaning the involvement of a Notified Body is now required under the EU IVDR).</p>
  <p>It’s also important to note that manufacturers won’t be able to use expired certificates, unless the EU has deemed them valid under specific conditions.</p>
  <p>So, if you’re relying on an EU IVDD CE certificate with extended validity under Article 110 to place devices on the GB market, be sure to <a href="https://aic.mhra.gov.uk/era/drsystem.nsf/a508926735cb834f802576880054e0c3/0afbc51d01dee249802577f0003861bb">update the MHRA Device Online Registration System</a> as outlined in the guidance. The devices can stay on the market until the 30th June 2030 (or until the certificate expires).</p>
  <h3 id="northern-ireland-ni">Northern Ireland (NI)</h3>
  <p>The rules for placing IVD devices on the NI market are different from those for GB. Since 26th May 2022, the EU IVDR has applied in both EU Member States and Northern Ireland.</p>
  <p>CE certificates with extended validity under the EU IVDR transitional arrangements (Article 110) can still be used to place devices on the NI market, as long as EU IVDD CE-marked medical devices are accepted.</p>
  <p>For these devices to be valid on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/medical-devices-eu-regulations-for-mdr-and-ivdr">NI market</a>, they must meet the conditions set out in Article 110(3c), including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Continued compliance with Directive 98/79/EC</li>
    <li>No significant changes to the design or intended purpose</li>
    <li>No unacceptable risk to the health or safety of patients, users, or others, or to public health protection</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Additionally, there are some important steps you must follow:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>By 26th May 2025, you’ll need to provide evidence that you’ve implemented a quality management system in accordance with EU IVDR Article 10(8).</li>
    <li>By 26th May 2025, you’ll also need to provide evidence that you or your authorised representative have made a formal application to a Notified Body.</li>
    <li>By 26th September 2025, you must provide evidence that both the Notified Body and the manufacturer have signed a written agreement.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you plan to rely on an EU IVDD CE certificate with extended validity under Article 110 for placing devices on the NI market, the MHRA encourages you to reflect this on the <a href="https://aic.mhra.gov.uk/era/drsystem.nsf/a508926735cb834f802576880054e0c3/0afbc51d01dee249802577f0003861bb">MHRA Device Online Registration System</a>.</p>
  <h3 id="previously-expired-certificates">Previously expired certificates</h3>
  <p>If you want to rely on a certificate that expired before 9th July 2024 but was still valid on 26th May 2022, you must upload a letter from the Notified Body. This letter should confirm that they’ve received the manufacturer’s application for conformity assessment and that a written agreement has been finalised.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, you could upload a completed template instead of the letter, which should declare that the key conditions for extending the certificate under EU IVDR Article 110 have been met. These conditions include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A signed contract with the Notified Body that was in place before the certificate expired, or</li>
    <li>If no contract existed at the time of expiry, confirmation that the manufacturer had received a derogation from conformity assessment procedures under Article 54(1) of the EU IVDR, or</li>
    <li>Confirmation that they were allowed extra time to complete the conformity assessment as per Article 92(1) of the EU IVDR.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="certificates-expiring-on-or-after-9th-july-2024">Certificates expiring on or after 9th July 2024</h3>
  <p>If you intend to rely on a certificate that was valid on 26th May 2022 and has expired on or after 9th July 2024, you must upload a letter from the Notified Body confirming that they have received the manufacturer’s application for conformity assessment and that a written agreement has been finalised.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, instead of the letter, you can upload a declaration stating that the certificate remains valid under <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/746/oj/eng">EU IVDR Article 110</a>.</p>

The General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs) are a key aspect of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017R0745">Medical Device Regulation (MDR)</a> and <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017R0746"><em>In Vitro</em> Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (IVDR)</a>, ensuring that medical devices in the European Union (EU) meet high standards of safety and performance. In our new GSPR series, we will take an in-depth look at each of the GSPRs, outlining the key requirements to ensure compliance.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mantrasystems_medicaldevices-gspr-mdr-activity-7262434101956165632-TaAy">GSPRs</a> specify the essential requirements that medical devices must meet to be placed on the market, and they cover a wide range of topics including design and manufacturing, risk management, labelling, and instructions for use. Compliance with the GSPRs is mandatory, and failure to meet these requirements can result in serious consequences, such as product recalls, fines, or legal action.</p>
  <p>In the first article of the GSPR series, we will be taking a look at GSPR 1:</p>
  <!-- TODO: Markup properly -->
  <blockquote>
    <p>“<em>Devices shall achieve the performance intended by their manufacturer and shall be designed and manufactured in such a way that, during normal conditions of use, they are suitable for their intended purpose. They shall be safe and effective and shall not compromise the clinical condition or the safety of patients, or the safety and health of users or, where applicable, other persons, provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety, taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art.</em>”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2 id="understanding-gspr1-the-basics">Understanding GSPR1: The Basics</h2>
  <p>GSPR 1 is one of the foundational requirements under the <a href="/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/ivdr-consulting">IVDR</a>/<a href="/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/mdr-consulting">MDR</a>, to regulate the safety and efficacy of medical devices in the EU. It outlines a comprehensive approach to ensuring that medical devices are safe, effective, and of high quality. This specific requirement focuses on ensuring that the design and manufacturing of these devices must prioritise safety in a way that minimises risk to both patients and users.</p>
  <p>The regulation mandates that manufacturers must design their devices with a comprehensive risk management process in place. This includes identifying potential risks and mitigating them through:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Design:</strong> The design phase involves developing the device in such a way that risks to patient safety and device performance are minimised. This could mean ensuring the device operates effectively under all intended conditions, incorporating fail-safes, or using ergonomic designs that reduce the likelihood of user error.</li>
    <li><strong>Material selection:</strong> Choosing the right materials is crucial to ensure that the device is safe for its intended use. This includes considering factors such as biocompatibility, durability, and potential for allergic reactions or other adverse events.</li>
    <li><strong>Testing before the device can be marketed or used on patients:</strong> Extensive testing is required before the device can be marketed. This involves testing to confirm that the device meets the required safety and performance standards. Testing helps to identify any potential issues that may not have been apparent during the design or material selection phases.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These safeguards are proposed to prevent harm in the short and long term.</p>
  <h2 id="gspr1-core-principles-you-need-to-know">GSPR1: Core Principles You Need to Know</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="/enable-ce-mark/online-video-training-courses/risk-management">Risk Management</a></strong> – A robust risk management system lies at the heart of GSPR 1. All possible hazards associated with the device, including any foreseeable misuse, need to be assessed by the manufacturer. These risk assessments must be done throughout the product’s lifetime, from design and development to production and use. One of the key aims is to ensure there is a minimal likelihood of harm, and if risks are identified, they are appropriately mitigated.</li>
    <li><strong>Quality</strong> – GSPR 1 stresses that the design and manufacturing process should ensure that the device maintains its performance for the duration of its use. The conditions that it is subjected to during its intended use should be withstood by the device, and manufacturers are to ensure its durability.</li>
    <li><strong>Biocompatibility</strong> – GSPR 1 mandates that the materials used in medical devices must be compatible with the human body, not causing any adverse reactions. Manufacturers must ensure that the material does not provoke harmful immune responses, toxicity, or irritation, regardless of whether the device will have direct or indirect contact with the patient. Biocompatibility testing is essential to verify that the materials used will not negatively affect patients. This is especially important for implantable devices or those that are used over extended periods.</li>
    <li><strong>Design Considerations</strong> – The design of the device plays a pivotal role in preventing user error. GSPR 1 requires that devices are designed in a way that reduces the risk of incorrect use – whether that be considerations like intuitive user interfaces, clear instructions, or an ergonomic design.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="why-gspr1-matters-key-reasons-for-compliance">Why GSPR1 Matters: Key Reasons for Compliance</h2>
  <p>GSPR 1 serves as a cornerstone of patient and user safety. By ensuring that safety and performance are prioritised from the earliest stages of design and manufacturing, this regulation aims to prevent potential harm before it happens.</p>
  <p>The requirement also fosters innovation in device design by encouraging manufacturers to continuously evaluate and enhance safety features. With an emphasis on risk management and continual improvement, GSPR 1 not only meets current needs but anticipates future challenges, allowing the medical device industry to respond effectively to evolving healthcare environments and patient needs.</p>
  <h2 id="the-bottom-line-gspr-1s-impact-on-the-future">The Bottom Line: GSPR 1’s Impact on the Future</h2>
  <p>GSPR 1 is fundamental within the MDR and IVDR and underscores the importance of designing and manufacturing devices that prioritise the safety and performance of both patients and users of the medical device. Through rigorous risk management, thought-out material selection, and user-centred design, GSPR 1 seeks to ensure that medical devices do not pose harm to those relying on them for care.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, GSPR 1 represents a commitment by the medical device industry to uphold the highest standards of safety and quality, fostering trust in devices that are critical to patient health and wellbeing.</p>

  <p>These vulnerabilities, which include a software backdoor, could compromise digital security and pose significant risks to patients when the devices are connected to the internet. As more medical devices become internet-connected, this development underscores the critical importance of robust cybersecurity measures in protecting patient safety and data.</p>
  <p>While the FDA’s warning highlights the risks, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/745/oj/eng">EU Medical Device Regulations (MDR)</a> and <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/746/oj/eng">In-Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (IVDR)</a> introduced stricter safety requirements to address such challenges. These regulations apply to medical devices that incorporate electronic programmable systems and software, which are now classified as medical devices themselves. Manufacturers must design and manufacture devices in accordance with the state of the art by applying risk management principles, including information security. Additionally, the regulations establish minimum IT security requirements, including protection against unauthorised access.</p>
  <p>In this article we discuss cybersecurity requirements of the EU MDR and IVDR and summarise the Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) guidance document - <a href="https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/download/b23b362f-8a56-434c-922a-5b3ca4d0a7a1_en">MDCG 2019-16 Rev 1</a>: Guidance on Cybersecurity for medical devices.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-cybersecurity">What is cybersecurity?</h2>
  <p>In ISO 81001-1, cybersecurity is defined as:</p>
  <!-- TODO:Markup properly -->
  <blockquote>
    <p>“<em>a state where information and systems are protected from unauthorised activities, such as access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction to a degree that the related risks to confidentiality, integrity, and availability are maintained at an acceptable level throughout the life cycle</em>”.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2 id="what-guidance-does-the-mdcg-2019-16-rev-1-provide">What guidance does the MDCG 2019-16 Rev 1 provide?</h2>
  <p>The MDCG 2019-16 Rev 1 provides guidance on fulfilling the general safety and performance requirements of Annex I of the EU MDR and IVDR concerning cybersecurity. It emphasises a “secure by design” approach, integrating cybersecurity into every stage of a medical device’s lifecycle. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Security Risk Management:</strong> Manufacturers must establish a process to identify, evaluate, and mitigate cybersecurity risks, aligning with the overall risk management system required by the MDR.</li>
    <li><strong>Security Capabilities:</strong> Devices should incorporate essential security features such as authentication, encryption, and malware protection, tailored to their intended use and operational environment.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum IT Requirements:</strong> Manufacturers must define and communicate the minimum IT security requirements for the device’s operating environment, including hardware and network characteristics, to ensure baseline protection.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The guidance also addresses the complex medical device supply chain, providing supplementary considerations for actors other than manufacturers. Additionally, it includes an annex outlining other EU and global legislation and guidance relevant to cybersecurity.</p>
  <h2 id="what-are-the-cybersecurity-requirements-contained-in-mdr-annex-i">What are the cybersecurity requirements contained in MDR Annex I?</h2>
  <h3 id="basic-cybersecurity-requirements">Basic Cybersecurity Requirements</h3>
  <p>Annex I of the MDR and IVDR emphasise the importance of cybersecurity in maintaining the general safety and performance requirements of medical devices with a focus on cybersecurity. The requirements are categorised into three key areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>IT Security:</strong> Protecting the information technology systems of medical devices is crucial. This includes safeguarding against unauthorised access and ensuring data integrity (referencing sections 17.4, 23.4ab).</li>
    <li><strong>Operation Security:</strong> Devices must operate securely under all conditions. This involves ensuring that the device functions as intended without compromising safety (referencing sections 14.1, 14.2, 17.1).</li>
    <li><strong>Information Security:</strong> Protecting sensitive data is a top priority. Medical devices must ensure that patient data and other critical information are secure from breaches (referencing section 17.2).</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="requirements-for-the-secure-design-and-manufacture-of-medical-devices">Requirements for the Secure Design and Manufacture of Medical Devices</h3>
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/content/articles/inline/understanding-cybersecurity-requirements-for-medical-devices.svg" alt="Diagram illustrating the components considered for the cybersecurity of medical devices." loading="lazy" width="800" height="566" />
    <figcaption>Cybersecurity considerations for the design and manufacturing of medical devices</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Cybersecurity must be integrated into every stage of a medical device’s lifecycle. Annex I of the MDR and IVDR highlights several critical aspects of secure design and manufacture:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Risks must be identified, assessed, and managed throughout the device’s lifecycle (sections 3, 14.4, 14.5, 19.3).</li>
    <li><strong>Protection Against Risks:</strong> Devices must be designed to protect against risks during both intended use and foreseeable misuse (sections 3c, 8).</li>
    <li><strong>Unauthorised Access:</strong> Measures must be in place to prevent unauthorised access to the device and its data (sections 17.4, 18.8).</li>
    <li><strong>Threats and Vulnerabilities:</strong> Manufacturers must identify and address security threats, vulnerabilities, and risks (section 4b).</li>
    <li><strong>Risk Control Measures:</strong> Effective risk control measures must be established to mitigate identified risks (section 4).</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum IT Security Requirements:</strong> Devices must meet minimum IT security standards to ensure baseline protection (sections 17.4, 14.5).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A key driver of secure design and manufacturing is the <strong>state of the art</strong> (sections 1, 4, 17.2). Manufacturers should consider the state of the art when designing developing and upgrading medical devices across their life cycle. This involves incorporating the latest advancements, technologies, and best practices into their decision-making processes to address security risks proportionally and appropriately. By aligning with the state of the art, manufacturers can ensure that their devices are not only compliant with regulatory requirements but also resilient against emerging threats, safeguarding patient safety and data security over the long term.</p>
  <h3 id="how-are-the-cybersecurity-requirements-under-mdr-interrelated-to-the-other-relevant-eu-legislations-cybersecurity-act-gdpr-and-nis">How are the cybersecurity requirements under MDR interrelated to the other relevant EU legislations (Cybersecurity Act, GDPR and NIS)?</h3>
  <p>Cybersecurity requirements under the MDR are interconnected with other EU legislations, such as the Cybersecurity Act, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive. While the EU MDR and IVDR focus on the safety and performance of medical devices, these additional legislations address broader aspects of cybersecurity, data protection, and network security. The <a href="https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/download/b23b362f-8a56-434c-922a-5b3ca4d0a7a1_en">MDCG 2019-16 Rev 1</a> guidance provides a detailed discussion of how these requirements overlap and complement each other.</p>
  <h3 id="what-cybersecurity-activities-does-the-manufacturer-need-to-carry-out-during-the-lifecycle-of-a-medical-device-according-to-mdr">What cybersecurity activities does the manufacturer need to carry out during the lifecycle of a medical device according to MDR?</h3>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/applying-unique-device-identifier-step-by-step-guide-mantrasystems-v7dqe/">Unique Device Identifier (UDI)</a> is a crucial element in the medical device industry, designed to enhance the traceability and safety of medical devices. Think of UDI as a sort of “digital fingerprint” for each device—a unique combination of numbers and codes that provide important details about the device, such as its model, manufacturing batch, and more. It’s like putting a <em>superpower</em> into your device packaging, empowering manufacturers, regulators, and healthcare providers to quickly identify and track a device.</p>
  <p>A UDI is made up of two core components:</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/content/articles/inline/breaking-down-the-udi.svg" alt="Diagram illustrating the UDI-DI vs UDI-PI split." loading="lazy" width="840" height="290" />
  </figure>
  <h3 id="1-udi-di-device-identifier">1. UDI-DI (Device Identifier)</h3>
  <p>This is the fixed portion of the UDI and uniquely identifies the model or version of the device. It’s used to identify the product at a high level, no matter where it is sold or used. The UDI-DI is assigned by the manufacturer and remains constant across all units of that particular device.</p>
  <h3 id="2-udi-pi-production-identifier">2. UDI-PI (Production Identifier)</h3>
  <p>The variable portion of the UDI includes critical details about the device, such as its serial number, lot number, expiry date, or manufacture date. This part of the UDI ensures the traceability of each individual unit, making it easy to track and manage the device throughout its lifecycle.</p>
  <h2 id="whats-the-udi-carrier">What’s the UDI Carrier?</h2>
  <p>The UDI carrier is the machine-readable version of the UDI that is placed on the label or packaging of the medical device. It’s typically a barcode or QR code—something that can be quickly scanned by healthcare providers, distributors, or anyone handling the device. UDI carriers make tracking the device in real-time much more efficient.</p>
  <p>There are two common forms of UDI carriers:</p>

    <img src="/assets/images/content/articles/inline/which-udi-carrier.svg" alt="Diagram showing which UDI carrier should be used for medical devices?" loading="lazy" width="744" height="309" />
  </figure>
  <p>In accordance with Annex VI, Part C, Section 4.1, the UDI Carrier – both the Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) and the Human Readable Interpretation (HRI) must be placed on the label, the device itself, and all higher packaging levels. However, Section 4.2 allows the UDI carrier to be placed on the next higher packaging level if space on the unit of use packaging is limited. Additionally, Section 4.3 states that for single-use devices of Classes I and IIa, the UDI carrier is not required on the individual packaging but must appear on the next higher packaging level (e.g., a carton containing multiple devices).</p>
  <h2 id="understanding-udi-and-eudamed">Understanding UDI and EUDAMED</h2>
  <p>Under the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/745/oj/eng">EU MDR 2017/745</a>, medical device manufacturers must submit UDI data to <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/eudamed">EUDAMED</a> for all devices that fall under the regulation. Here’s how UDI submission fits into EUDAMED:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Manufacturers must submit UDI-DI information for each product (or product model) to EUDAMED to ensure that it is tracked in the European market.</li>
    <li>UDI-DI Data: This includes the unique identifier for each device, along with essential details such as the device’s name, model, classification, and the manufacturer’s information.</li>
    <li>EUDAMED Registration: Manufacturers must first register in EUDAMED to begin submitting UDI-DI information. Only those devices that are subject to MDR or IVDR are required to be listed in EUDAMED.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="udi-format-explained">UDI Format Explained</h2>
  <p>In the HRI format, you can see the UDI-DI, which is the number after the (01). Each time you see the 01 between brackets, this means this is the placeholder for the UDI-DI.</p>
  <p>Then, we arrive at the UDI-PI part. As mentioned, this part can vary depending on the production characteristic of the product.</p>
  <p>You can identify some numbers in the bracket on the UDI-PI part. Let’s decode them. Each of these numbers provides specific information about the product:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>(10) is for the lot number</li>
    <li>(11) is for the production date</li>
    <li>(17) defines the expiration date</li>
    <li>(21) is the serial number.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example: (01)00827002005112­(17)000004(10)­1234(21)8234</strong></p>
  <p>All this information is dynamic and will have to change each time you have a new batch or a new expiry date.</p>
  <h2 id="the-basic-udi-di">The Basic UDI-DI</h2>
  <p>The Basic UDI-DI is an EU approach for linking devices to their regulatory documentation and it is intended to uniquely identify the product model throughout the entire life cycle of the product.</p>
  <p>The Basic UDI-DI is a primary identifier of a device model i.e. it connects devices with the same intended purpose, risk class, and essential design and manufacturing characteristics. It is also the main record key in the UDI database i.e. it connects all associated UDI-DIs in the UDI database with the information in other EUDAMED modules.</p>
  <p>You’ll have it on your:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Certificates (Notified Bodies)</li>
    <li>Declaration of conformity</li>
    <li>Technical Documentation</li>
    <li>Summary of safety and clinical performance</li>
    <li>Certificate of free sale (Article 60(1) of MDR)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This one does not appear on the packaging of the products. It’s really an invisible number for your customers and is used solely in administration.</p>
  <h2 id="decoding-udi-strategic-takeaways">Decoding UDI: Strategic Takeaways</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, understanding and implementing the Unique Device Identifier (UDI) system is crucial for ensuring the safety, traceability, and regulatory compliance of medical devices. By breaking down the components of UDI, such as the UDI-DI, UDI-PI, and their formats (AIDC and HRI), manufacturers can streamline their processes and meet both EU and global regulatory requirements.</p>
  <p>With the correct application of UDI, medical device manufacturers enhance transparency, facilitate recalls, and ultimately contribute to better patient safety and device management in healthcare systems worldwide.</p>

To ensure compliance, manufacturers must thoroughly understand the classification rules outlined in Annex VIII of the IVDR.</p>
  <h2 id="what-has-changed">What has changed?</h2>
  <p>A significant change for manufacturers with the <a href="/articles/ivdd-ivdr-ensuring-compliance-during-transitional-period">transition from IVDD 98/79/EC to EU IVDR 2017/746</a> is the shift in classification of <em>in vitro</em> diagnostic medical devices from a “list-based” system to a “risk-based” approach.</p>
  <p>Under the IVDD, devices were categorized into List A and List B based on specific medical conditions. Devices on these lists required Notified Body submission, while all others were considered self-certifiable.</p>
  <p>In alignment with EU MDR, classification of <em>in vitro</em> diagnostic medical devices is now risk-based and moves through a system of class A, B, C and D. This classification considers both patient risk and broader public health implications. To achieve this, the IVDR makes use of 10 implementation rules and 7 classification rules to classify <em>in vitro</em> medical devices (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/746/oj/eng#anx_VIII">Annex VIII IVDR</a>).</p>
  <h2 id="risk-categories-explained">Risk categories explained</h2>
  <p>The risk of <em>in vitro</em> diagnostic medical devices is assessed based on the potential consequences of an incorrect result or diagnosis.</p>
  <p>Class A is the lowest risk category. It includes general laboratory devices, instruments and specimen receptacles. Non-sterile Class A devices can self-certify for a CE mark, meaning that they do not have to complete the process of conformity through a Notified Body.</p>
  <p>Class B risk category is the default class for all <em>in vitro</em> medical devices which are not covered specifically by other classification rules. It covers devices which are considered to be lower risk to patients and to the wider population. Examples include self-testing devices for pregnancy and fertility, self-testing kits for blood cholesterol or glucose levels, and urine tests for white or red blood cells, or bacteria.</p>
  <p>Class C includes IVDs that pose a lower risk to the wider population but a higher risk to the patient if the test result is inaccurate. In these cases, a diagnostic failure could have life-threatening consequences, such as in tests for infectious diseases or cancer. This class also covers companion diagnostics and genetic screening. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-companion-diagnostics-what-you-need-know-iyche/">Companion diagnostics</a> are IVDs which provide information which is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug or biological product.</p>
  <p>The highest risk classification is Class D. This class includes IVDs which test for general life-threatening conditions, and more specifically, for highly transmissible infectious agents in blood and biological material, which may be transplanted or readministered into the body. These transmissible agents may also present a high risk to the wider population. Class D also includes IVDs for blood grouping and tissue typing.</p>
  <h2 id="consequences-of-the-new-classification-rules">Consequences of the new classification rules</h2>
  <p>A major impact of the new risk classification system under IVDR is that approximately 78% of IVDs now require Notified Body certification, a significant increase from just 8% under the previous IVDD1. Initially there was a backlog in conformity assessments due to the low number of IVDR designated NBs. However, that has been rectified to some extent, with 12 notified bodies designated for IVDR submissions as of October 2024.</p>
  <p>Results from a recent Notified Body survey2 on certifications and applications, performed by the European Commission, found that one of the primary reasons for IVDR application refusals of IVDR applications was “wrong qualification/classification of device”. This highlights the importance of understanding and implementing the classification rules of Annex VII of the IVDR prior to the production of the technical file.</p>

This document is intended to promote the development of safe, effective, and <a href="/solutions/regulatory-consulting-for-samd-software-as-a-medical-device">high-quality AI-enabled medical devices</a>.</p>
  <p>The ten guiding principles are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Well-defined intended use:</strong> AI-enabled medical devices must be designed and used to address clinically meaningful needs. This requires a thorough understanding of the device’s intended use, benefits, and risks throughout its lifecycle. Multidisciplinary expertise should be leveraged to ensure safety and effectiveness.</li>
    <li><strong>Good software engineering, medical device design, and security practices:</strong> It is vital to ensure robust software engineering practices are implemented throughout the product life cycle. This can be achieved by using validated quality management systems and quality assurance tools, as well as following strict data management and cybersecurity protocols. This also includes having well-structured risk management and design processes to ensure confidence in the outputs of the model.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/clinical-evaluation">Clinical evaluation</a> with representative datasets:</strong> Data collection protocols must ensure the datasets used for training, testing, and monitoring the AI model sufficiently represent the intended patient population, use environment, and inputs. This helps manage bias, promote generalisability, assess usability, and identify potential underperformance.</li>
    <li><strong>Independent training and test datasets:</strong> Training and test datasets should be selected and maintained independently of one another. All potential sources of dependence, including factors related to patients, sites, and data acquisition, should be considered and addressed.</li>
    <li><strong>Fit-for-purpose reference standards:</strong> Accepted methods for developing reference standards should be used to ensure that clinically relevant and well-characterised data is collected. The limitations of reference standards should be understood, and the rationale for their choice should be documented based on the device’s intended use and assessment of their suitability for the intended use environment.</li>
    <li><strong>Model choice and design tailored to data and intended use:</strong> The choice and design of the AI model should be evaluated and shown to be suitable for the available data and support the mitigation of known risks such as overfitting, performance degradation, and security risks. The clinical benefits and risks related to the product should be well understood and used to derive clinically meaningful performance goals for testing.</li>
    <li><strong>Assessment of human-AI interactions:</strong> Device performance should be evaluated within its intended use environment and clinical workflow, considering interactions with all users. Human factors like user skills, understanding of model outputs, potential for overreliance, device autonomy, and user error should be addressed for both normal use and foreseeable misuse.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance testing in clinically relevant conditions:</strong> Methodologically and statistically sound test plans should be developed and executed to generate clinically relevant device performance information independently of the training dataset. Considerations should include the intended patient population, relevant subgroups, clinical environment, use by the human-AI team, measurement inputs, and potential confounding factors.</li>
    <li><strong>Clear and essential information for users:</strong> All users (healthcare professionals, patients, etc.) must receive clear, relevant information about the product’s intended use, indications, benefits, risks, performance, and limitations. This includes details about the model’s development, data used, inputs, outputs, and user interface. Users should also be informed about device updates and have a way to report concerns to the manufacturer.</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring of deployed models and management of re-training risks:</strong> Deployed models should be capable of ongoing monitoring in real-world use with a focus on maintaining or improving safety and performance. When models are retrained after deployment, appropriate controls should be in place to manage risks of overfitting, unintended bias, or degradation of the model that may impact safety and performance.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>These guiding principles are a call to action for international standards organisations, regulators, and other collaborative bodies to further advance GMLP. Areas of collaboration include research, educational tools and resources, international harmonisation, and consensus standards to inform regulatory policies and guidelines.</p>

  </figure>
  <p>The IMDRF emphasises the importance of GMLP in the context of evolving AI technologies, particularly generative AI. Generative AI presents unique considerations and potential risks, such as the use of foundation models not under the provenance of medical device manufacturers. The regulatory science of measuring performance and characterising and detecting errors in these models is maturing to meet these challenges.</p>
  <p>As the field of AI medical devices continues to evolve, so too must GMLP and consensus standards. The IMDRF’s publication of these guiding principles is a significant step in promoting the safe and effective development of AI-enabled medical devices. Medical device manufacturers should familiarise themselves with these principles and incorporate them into their development processes to ensure compliance and maintain patient safety.</p>

This update, released in January 2025, provides critical clarifications and insights for medical device manufacturers, aiming to ensure accurate and consistent use of the EMDN system.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-the-emdn-and-how-does-it-affect-me">What is the EMDN, and how does it affect me?</h2>
  <p>The EMDN is a standardised system for classifying and identifying medical devices within the European Union. Introduced under Article 26 of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/745/oj/eng">Medical Device Regulation (MDR) (EU) 2017/745</a> and Article 23 of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/746/oj/eng">In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (IVDR) (EU) 2017/746</a>, the EMDN plays a crucial role in the functioning of the <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/eudamed">European Database on Medical Devices (EUDAMED)</a>.</p>
  <p>Manufacturers utilise the EMDN to register their devices in EUDAMED, linking each device with a Unique Device Identifier - Device Identifier (UDI-DI). Beyond registration, the EMDN is vital for device documentation, notified body assessments, post-market surveillance, vigilance activities, and data analysis. It serves as a key reference for all stakeholders, including patients, providing clear device descriptions and promoting transparency in the medical device market. The EMDN is reviewed and updated annually based on user feedback and practical use.   </p>

  <p>MDCG <a href="https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/de470384-e8be-45e7-a334-226757f8816d_en">2024-2 Rev.1</a> contains a detailed explanation of the annual EMDN revision process. The most important part of the process for manufacturers is the collection of requests step. EMDN users, including competent authorities, notified bodies, manufacturers, and other stakeholders, can submit requests for changes to the EMDN through a dedicated platform. The deadline for submitting requests for processing in that same year is 31st January.  </p>
  <p>These requests are then reviewed by the EMDN Technical Team (EMDN-TT) and the MDCG Nomenclature Working Group (NOM WG) over the course of the year before finally being published to EUDAMED by the end of the year.</p>
  <p>In addition to the annual update cycle, a pilot procedure for ad-hoc updates requiring expedited review has been introduced. This ad-hoc process is limited to new code requests and is only available to competent authorities and notified bodies.  </p>
  <h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-me">What does this mean for me?</h2>
  <p>This update underscores the importance of staying informed about EMDN changes and ensuring accurate EMDN code assignment for all medical devices. Manufacturers must proactively engage with the annual EMDN review process, participate in code update proposals, and maintain accurate device information in EUDAMED.</p>
  <p>By adhering to these guidelines manufacturers can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Enhance Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Accurate EMDN coding is crucial for meeting regulatory requirements and avoiding potential issues with notified bodies and market access.</li>
    <li><strong>Improve Data Quality:</strong> Consistent and precise EMDN coding contributes to the quality and reliability of data in EUDAMED, supporting effective post-market surveillance and regulatory decision-making.</li>
    <li><strong>Increase Transparency:</strong> Clear and standardised device identification through the EMDN promotes transparency for patients, healthcare professionals, and other stakeholders.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The MDCG have provided valuable guidance for medical device manufacturers navigating the EMDN system. By understanding and implementing these guidelines, manufacturers can ensure accurate device classification, maintain regulatory compliance, and contribute to a transparent and well-functioning medical device market.</p>

  <h2 id="implementing-an-ivdr-compliant-qms">Implementing an IVDR-Compliant QMS</h2>
  <p>Having an IVDR complaint QMS in place is not just about meeting regulatory requirements; it is a proactive strategy to ensure the continuous safety and performance of an IVD in a competitive market. To meet IVDR requirements, the QMS must include the following elements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A strategy for regulatory compliance, including management of modifications to devices.</li>
    <li>Identification of safety and performance requirements and strategies to address them.</li>
    <li>Clear management responsibility and accountability.</li>
    <li>Resource management, including oversight of suppliers and subcontractors.</li>
    <li>Comprehensive risk management in line with Annex I, Section 3.</li>
    <li>Performance evaluation, including Post-Market Performance Follow-up (PMPF) per Article 56 and Annex XIII.</li>
    <li>Processes for product realisation, from design and development to production and service.</li>
    <li>Verification of <strong>Unique Device Identifier (UDI)</strong> assignments and consistent device information management under Articles 24(3) and 26.</li>
    <li>A robust <strong>Post-Market Surveillance (PMS)</strong> system, as outlined in Article 78.</li>
    <li>Effective communication with stakeholders, including authorities, notified bodies, and customers.</li>
    <li>Processes for reporting serious incidents and implementing corrective and preventive actions (CAPA).</li>
    <li>Monitoring, measurement, and continuous product improvement.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="an-ivdr-compliant-qms-for-legacy-devices">An IVDR-Compliant QMS for Legacy Devices</h2>
  <p>Manufacturers must ensure their QMS is aligned with IVDR regulatory requirements. However, for certain aspects outlined in Article 10(8), such as points (b), (e), and (f), a distinction must be made for “legacy devices”. For these devices, manufacturers are not required to have identified all relevant safety and performance requirements, implemented comprehensive risk management, or conducted a full performance evaluation. However, it is important to note that from the 26 May 2025, manufacturers must ensure that their QMS addresses how compliance with these requirements will be achieved for legacy devices, ensuring full alignment with IVDR standards.</p>
  <p>Manufacturers have a few strategic options for updating to an IVDR-compliant QMS. One approach is to establish a parallel QMS. This approach enables clear reference to the appropriate procedures and highlights the transition to the new system. For companies with complex, long-standing QMS, it offers the chance to streamline and enhance efficiency. However, this approach demands considerable effort to develop and eventually replace the old procedures.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, companies whose existing QMS already aligns closely with the new IVDR requirements might prefer to update their current system. While this option can be more efficient, it may present challenges in ensuring that certain QMS elements are applied consistently across all products.</p>
  <p>Despite the chosen approach, documenting the transition is critical, clearly defining which procedures apply, when they take effect, and which products they impact. This can be done either within the procedures themselves or through a separate project plan. In addition, comprehensive training is key to ensuring everyone involved understands and implements the new requirements effectively.</p>
  <h2 id="the-time-to-act-is-now">The Time to Act Is Now</h2>
  <p>As the transition deadlines approach, manufacturers of legacy IVDs need to act swiftly to remain competitive and compliant in the evolving European market. The IVDR represents a major overhaul of IVD regulation in the EU, but it aims to ensure medical devices are safer, more effective, and of higher quality. Manufacturers who embrace these changes and take proactive steps to comply will be better positioned to navigate the evolving regulatory environment, ensuring continued market access and patient safety.</p>
