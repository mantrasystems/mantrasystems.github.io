              <p>Unless you have spent time working with medical device legislation in the past, the fact that software can be a medical device may be rather unexpected. Nonetheless, it is the case. Whether it is a stand-alone product (medical app) or software embedded within a hardware device, almost all software that has a medical purpose will be classed as a medical device and subject to the full force of medical device legislation.</p>
              <p>This can pose a significant challenge for software developers who may have limited experience working with medical device regulatory processes. At Mantra Systems, we have extensive experience in developing regulatory frameworks for producers of medical software.</p>
              <h2 id="is-my-software-product-a-medical-device">Is my software product a medical device?</h2>
              <p>Not all software associated with the provision of healthcare will be classified as a medical device. The new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745 will only apply to software that has a <strong>medical purpose on its own</strong> and that falls within the definition of “medical device” in MDR Article 2.</p>
              <p>It is vital that all manufacturers of medical software understand whether their products will be classed as a medical device. Marketing software as a medical device without appropriate authorisation and a CE-mark is a serious offence.</p>

              <p>If a software product is classified as a medical device, then the full range of provisions in the Medical Device Regulation 2017/745 (“The MDR”) will apply. This means that the software producer must implement a range of systems and regulatory processes in order to comply with requirements in the MDR. Some of the processes required in relation to software as a medical device include a:</p>
