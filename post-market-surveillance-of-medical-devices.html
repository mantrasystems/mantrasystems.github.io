              <h2 id="what-are-the-mdr-requirements-for-post-market-surveillance-of-medical-devices">What are the MDR requirements for Post Market Surveillance of medical devices?</h2>
              <p>MDR Article 2 defines Post Market Surveillance (PMS) as “a structured process of monitoring the safety of a medical device following its release onto the market”. PMS involves proactive collection and review of data relating to clinical experience with the subject medical device.</p>
              <p>MDR requirements for Post Market Surveillance of medical devices are outlined in Article 83, which states that every manufacturer must <strong>plan, establish, document, implement, maintain and update</strong> a PMS system for every medical device. The system must be designed and documented in a PMS Plan and then constantly updated according to a structured assessment of its effectiveness and the data it has collected. Effective MDR Post Market Surveillance requires a combination of processes and systems that work together to develop a robust ‘picture’ of how medical devices are performing.</p>
              <p>Developing a system for Post Market Surveillance of medical devices under the MDR is a complex task. Mistakes made when designing PMS systems can be difficult and expensive to rectify, and may even threaten the regulatory status of the device. Avoid these problems by working with our team of expertly-trained medical doctors who are specialists at designing Post Market Surveillance systems for compliance with the MDR.</p>
              <h2 id="how-does-post-market-surveillance-of-medical-devices-monitor-product-performance">How does Post Market Surveillance of medical devices monitor product performance?</h2>
              <p>Well-designed Post Market Surveillance systems can be thought of as monitoring the performance of medical devices in two complementary domains:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Post Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF)</strong> that involves the design and conduct of clinical studies to prospectively assess clinical safety and performance</li>
                <li><strong>Vigilance systems</strong> that monitor and respond to complaints, trends, and serious incidents relating to medical devices</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The MDR calls for more comprehensive and robust Post Market Surveillance that that required under the MDD. In particular, requirements for Post Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) are much more extensive under the MDR, detailed in MDR Annex XIV Part B.</p>
              <p>PMCF and vigilance should run in parallel with each performing an essential task in monitoring the performance of a medical device. PMCF can be thought of as more proactive, setting out to collect data whether favourable or un-favourable. Vigilance can be considered to be more reactive - it forms a system that responds to an undesirable outcome (whether a complaint or serious incident) in the event that one occurs.</p>
              <p>Field Safety Corrective Actions (FSCAs) - corrective procedures launched in response to a serious incident - are a further component of Post Market Surveillance of medical devices under the MDR, as are Field Safety Notices (FSNs) that communicate the outcome of FSCAs to users of the medical device in the market.</p>
              <h2 id="how-will-post-market-surveillance-of-medical-devices-be-assessed-under-the-mdr">How will Post Market Surveillance of medical devices be assessed under the MDR?</h2>
              <p>Post Market Surveillance of medical devices will be assessed through scrutiny of technical documents produced in relation to the system, as well as through the process of Clinical Evaluation that, in part, is fed by the results of PMS.</p>
              <p>MDR Annex III details requirements for technical documentation relating to Post Market Surveillance. In the case of Class IIa, IIb and III devices, technical documents must be assessed by a Notified Body as part of the conformity assessment process for the device. Although documents relating to Class I devices do not need to be submitted to a Notified Body, they must still be produced and the manufacturer falls under the jurisdiction of the MHRA and its regulatory powers under the MDR.</p>
              <p>Producing PMS technical documents is a technical task that requires extensive medical, regulatory and industry expertise. At Mantra Systems, our specially-trained healthcare professionals bring medical and industry expertise to the design of MDR Post Market Surveillance systems. Contact us today to discuss your requirements.</p>
              <h2 id="what-post-market-surveillance-documents-must-be-produced-for-medical-devices-under-the-mdr">What Post Market Surveillance documents must be produced for medical devices under the MDR?</h2>
              <p>Post Market Surveillance systems of all medical devices under the MDR require a <strong>PMS Plan</strong> that describes how data will be collected and used from a range of different sources, including serious incidents, Field Safety Corrective Actions (FSCAs), complaints, databases and/or registries, and complaints.</p>
              <p>The PMS plan must contain the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>A documented process to collect information from the above sources</li>
                <li>Methods to assess collected data</li>
                <li>Rationale used during risk analysis</li>
                <li>Methods for collecting and investigating complaints and analysing trends</li>
                <li>Methods for communicating with competent authorities and notified bodies</li>
                <li>Methods for tracking devices</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Additionally, a <strong>PMS output report</strong> must be produced in relation to all medical devices. The format of this report varies according to the device’s risk class:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>For Class I devices a <strong>PMS Report</strong> is required that simply summarises outcomes from PMS activities relating to the device.</li>
                <li>For all other device classes a detailed <strong>Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR)</strong> must be produced with a periodicity that varies according to risk class (at least annually for Class III).</li>
              </ul>
