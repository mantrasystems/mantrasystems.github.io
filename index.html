        <span>An introduction to</span>
        Real World Evidence for EU MDR Compliance
      </h2>

      <p>26th May 2020 marks the end of the transition period from the old Medical Device Directive (MDD) to the new Medical Device Regulations (MDR) 2017/745.</p>
    </div>

    <ol class="row info-blocks no-gutter">
      <li class="col col-4 two">
        <h3>Enhanced standards</h3>
        <p>From 26th May 2020, the MDR will be in full effect and MDR compliance will be mandatory for all EU-based medical device manufacturers. This will require them to meet the enhanced standards of the new legislation.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="col col-4 two pop">
        <h3>New requirements</h3>
        <p>The MDR introduces a range of new requirements for drafting technical documentation, as well as mandating a more comprehensive clinical evidence portfolio that supports safety and efficacy for every individual indication.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="col col-4 two">
        <h3>New challenges</h3>
        <p>Medical device companies are facing new challenges in meeting the requirements for MDR compliance. Claims of equivalence may fail and the need to evidence every indication places huge demands on evidence-generation systems.</p>
      </li>

        </div>

        <div class="col col-8">
          <h3 class="one">Why has the Medical Device Directive (MDD) been replaced?</h3>

          <p>Although generally robust and relatively permissive of innovation, the MDD was considered to have numerous flaws in enforcing medical device safety, reliability and general product quality, exposed by notorious incidents such as <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/metal-metal-hip-implants/concerns-about-metal-metal-hip-implants" target="_blank">the metal-on-metal hip scandal</a>. Legislators were compelled to implement reform.</p>

          <p>The new MDR attempts to reduce the likelihood of future incidents of this nature by tightening the requirements for proving safety and effectiveness of all medical devices, regardless of how long the product has been on the market.</p>

        <div class="col col-8">
          <h3 class="one">How will the industry be affected?</h3>

          <p>From an industry perspective, the most important changes are the need to provide evidence <i>"on an ongoing basis"</i> to support every individual indication, in parallel with the reduced capacity to claim equivalence to devices already approved for sale. Read a further <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-medical-device-regulation-what-s-44777/" target="_blank">detailed summary of the changes</a>.</p>

          <p>These changes mean that manufacturers across the industry face a significantly increased evidence-generation burden, meaning a potentially huge increase in cost to meet the demands for medical device compliance. In some cases, this may even challenge the commercial viability of a product.</p>

        <span>The importance of</span>
        Real World Evidence
      </h2>

      <p>Real World Evidence (RWE) is clinical evidence obtained from Real World Data (RWD) - observational data generated from real-world use of devices rather than formal clinical trials.</p>
    </div>

    <ol class="info-blocks row no-gutter">
      <li class="col col-4 three">
        <h3>Robust systems</h3>
        <p>Real World Evidence can be challenging to generate. It requires a robust data collection system that is capable of harvesting data on an ongoing basis without introducing bias.</p>
      </li>

      <li class="col col-4 three pop">
        <h3>User focused</h3>
        <p>It also requires that data entry systems are sufficiently user-friendly to allow clinicians to enter data as a component of their standard practice.</p>
      </li>

      <li class="col col-4 three">
        <h3>Guided choice</h3>
        <p>There are multiple ways to generate RWE. Our objective is to ensure that our clients choose the method of real-world evidence generation that is right for them.</p>

        <div class="col col-8">
          <h3 class="two">Important factors</h3>

          <p>The choice of real world evidence generation method is driven by a combination of factors. Some of the factors to consider include:</p>

          <ul class="disc">
            <li>market sector</li>
            <li>availability of external data sources</li>
            <li>product type</li>
            <li>available company resources</li>
            <li>time and criticality</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

          </figure>
        </div>

        <div class="col col-8">
          <h3 class="two">Poor choices</h3>

          <p>Unfortunately, medical device manufacturers sometimes choose sub-optimal real world evidence collection methods. A poor choice of real world evidence generation methods can lead to an accumulation of problems over time, as weaknesses of either collection method or the data itself tend to compound as data collection is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Manufacturers may also find that compliance of investigators to data collection standards is often far below that required by regulatory frameworks supporting MDR compliance. This is especially the case if insufficient attention is given to the choice of data collection method.</p>

          <p>Ultimately, the wrong choice of real world evidence generation method leads to wasted time and money, and a critical problem remaining to be solved.</p>

        <div class="col col-8">
          <h3 class="two">Existing registries</h3>

          <p>Some market sectors are extremely fortunate in terms of real world evidence. In some clinical specialities there are already external or nationalised registries that collect data on the performance of multiple products within a sector.</p>

          <p>For example, the National Joint Registry in the UK collects real-world data on the performance of orthopaedic joint replacement implants. This is a rich source of real world evidence that companies can access to compile evidence for regulatory submission, and has the advantage of being consecutive, non-selective, and objective (ie administered by an external agent rather than the manufacturer of the product in question).</p>

          <p>Other market sectors are not so fortunate. In the absence of such nationalised registries, manufacturers must find other ways to generate real world evidence.</p>
