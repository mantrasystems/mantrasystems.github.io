      <p>Whether you’re drafting a <a href="/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/mdr-consulting/clinical-evaluation">Clinical Evaluation Report</a> (CER) or preparing an <a href="medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/ivdr-consulting">IVDR</a> or <a href="/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/mdr-consulting/">MDR submission</a>, there’s one golden rule everyone learns quickly: you feel the pressure to get it right the first time, because in this field, second chances are rare—and costly.</p>
      <p>And that pressure? It doesn’t just come from the clock. It comes from the complexity of the content, the coordination required across teams, and the ever-present reality that regulators aren’t grading on a curve.</p>
      <h2 id="why-the-clock-is-always-ticking-and-coordinating-moving-pieces">Why the Clock Is Always Ticking and Coordinating Moving Pieces</h2>
      <p>In regulatory writing, time is always a pressure point. While the device may be ready, the trial complete, and the data in hand, without well-aligned and structured documentation, the product can’t move forward. Writing typically happens late in the development cycle, and the responsibility to wrap it up quickly falls squarely on the regulatory team.</p>
      <p>Revisions might be allowed, but delays can have significant consequences, pushing back launch dates, sales forecasts, and patient access. In a competitive market, even a few weeks’ delay can make a huge impact.</p>
      <p>In other words, the sooner it’s done, the sooner it’s in the hands of the people who need it.</p>
      <p>Take the Clinical Evaluation Report (CER), for example. It requires input from clinical, risk, and quality teams, each working on different timelines. If one team is delayed or key data is missing, the regulatory writer is left to fill in the gaps. Yet the final document still needs to be clear, compliant, and scientifically sound. Managing these moving parts under intense time pressure is where the real challenge lies.</p>
      <p>And despite all this, the report must be coherent. It must make sense to regulators, and it must do so in language that’s both technically precise and easy to follow. Balancing scientific depth with regulatory clarity, while coordinating teams and racing deadlines, is what makes regulatory writing uniquely demanding.</p>
      <h2 id="time-pressure--technical-complexity--a-tough-combo">Time Pressure + Technical Complexity = A Tough Combo</h2>
      <p>Regulatory writing is anything but straightforward. It’s high-pressure work that requires interpreting complex data, aligning with evolving guidelines, and managing competing timelines. You’re expected to translate clinical, safety, or performance data into documents that meet both internal and regulatory expectations.</p>
      <p>Timelines are rarely in your favour, and last-minute data, shifting guidance, and delayed inputs from other teams are common. Yet, the final document still has to be accurate and on time.</p>
      <p>Under pressure, shortcuts can be tempting: citing claims without solid evidence, glossing over exclusions, or relying on unchecked references. These might seem small, but regulators spot them instantly. One inconsistency can spark a chain of questions, delaying approval. The internal cost involves pulling teams back into work they thought was finished, creating stress and draining resources.</p>
      <h2 id="how-to-manage-the-pressure">How To Manage the Pressure</h2>
      <p>While the pressure may never disappear entirely, you can develop strategies to manage it effectively and deliver strong submissions consistently. Here’s how:</p>
      <h3 id="1-build-time-buffers-wherever-possible-and-stick-to-them">1. Build Time Buffers Wherever Possible (and Stick to Them)</h3>
      <p>Time buffers aren’t just a luxury, they’re a necessity as things will go wrong. A key staff member will be on leave, a literature search might surface late-breaking studies, or a formatting requirement will change mid-review. Planning for the unexpected is what keeps your timeline intact.</p>
      <p>How to do it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create internal deadlines at least 3–5 working days before submission.</li>
        <li>Schedule a formal buffer period at the end of the review cycle for last-minute fixes, formatting, or unanticipated input.</li>
        <li>Use a Gantt chart or timeline visual to map dependencies and highlight bottlenecks early.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Tip: Treat internal deadlines like external ones. Lock them in calendars, send reminders, and keep them visible in team trackers so they’re taken just as seriously.</em></p>
      <h3 id="2-use-templates-and-checklists-to-reduce-cognitive-load">2. Use Templates and Checklists to Reduce Cognitive Load</h3>
      <p>Regulatory writing isn’t just about words, it’s about structure, traceability, and completeness. Using <a href="/enable-ce-mark/technical-document-templates/">well-maintained templates</a>, <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance">guides</a>, and <a href="/enable-ce-mark/technical-document-templates/mdr-compliance-checker-gap-analysis-tool">submission checklists</a> allows writers to focus on content rather than reformatting or double-checking document layout.</p>
      <p>Best practices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain validated templates for CERs, PMS Plans, SSCPs, and more.</li>
        <li>Create a library of pre-approved justifications, definitions, and citations.</li>
        <li>Use trackers or collaborative SharePoint folders to keep everything in one place.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Tip: Maintain a document library with pre-approved phrasing for recurring justifications, definitions, and regulatory language to speed up writing and ensure consistency.</em></p>
      <h3 id="3-clarify-the-why-behind-every-section">3. Clarify the “Why” Behind Every Section</h3>
      <p>When working fast, it’s easy to fall into the trap of filling sections with text that sounds right but lacks substance. Writers who stay close to the underlying intent of each section, whether it’s explaining benefit-risk, post-market follow-up, or equivalence, are better positioned to write persuasively and pass regulatory scrutiny.</p>
      <p><em>Tip: Before writing each section, note down the question you’re answering. For example: “What is the clinical benefit of this device, and how is it supported by evidence?” Then answer that clearly and directly.</em></p>
      <h3 id="4-align-stakeholders-early">4. Align Stakeholders Early</h3>
      <p>Regulatory writing relies on input from clinical, risk, and quality teams. When these inputs arrive late or out of sync, the whole writing timeline suffers.</p>
      <p>How to improve:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hold a project kick-off call to align timelines and expectations across teams.</li>
        <li>Share a high-level plan with key stakeholders early, especially if input will be staggered.</li>
        <li>Confirm who’s reviewing what, and when, to avoid overlaps or gaps.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example: For an MDR CER, a short cross-functional alignment meeting early in the project avoided weeks of back-and-forth during the review phase.</p>
      <h3 id="5-break-big-tasks-into-smaller-wins">5. Break Big Tasks into Smaller Wins</h3>
      <p>Large documents like CERs or SSCPs, and especially full Technical Files can feel overwhelming. Breaking the work into logical sections and setting mini-deadlines helps manage workload and keep momentum.</p>
      <p>What works:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Set internal milestones for key sections (e.g. clinical data, Annex II documents, risk-benefit).</li>
        <li>Track progress visibly so the team stays motivated and aligned.</li>
        <li>Divide the document by section (e.g. clinical background, state of the art, risk-benefit analysis, PMS summary) and assign clear ownership where possible.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Tip: Celebrate section sign-offs as mini-successes—they build confidence and maintain pace. Also, create a visual dashboard (even a basic traffic-light tracker in Excel) to show section status, e.g., red for in progress, amber for under review, green for approved. It helps everyone see at a glance where things stand and what needs focus next.</em></p>
      <p><strong>Bonus benefit:</strong> Smaller chunks are also easier to quality check, making it more likely that errors or inconsistencies are spotted early—before they snowball into regulatory queries.</p>
      <h3 id="6-learn-from-every-submission">6. Learn from Every Submission</h3>
      <p>Every regulatory submission, whether smooth, delayed, or somewhere in between, is packed with lessons. The key is capturing those insights while they’re still fresh and feeding them back into future projects. That’s how teams evolve from “just getting it done” to building consistently efficient, high-quality submissions.</p>
      <p>How to do it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hold post-submission meetings: Within a week or two of submitting, schedule a short debrief session. Ask: What went well? What slowed us down? What could we do differently next time?</li>
        <li>Involve everyone: Writers, project managers, and any contributors should have a voice. Often, the people managing literature, quality checks, or stakeholder feedback have the best insights into where time was lost, or saved.</li>
        <li>Document and apply learnings: Keep a running log of tips, regulatory feedback, time-saving methods, and submission pitfalls.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="conclusion-high-pressure-high-standardsmanageable-with-the-right-tools">Conclusion: High Pressure, High Standards—Manageable with the Right Tools</h2>
      <p>There’s no denying that writing regulatory documents under tight deadlines can be intense. The expectations are high, the work is technical, and the timelines are often compressed. But by planning strategically, working collaboratively, and using the right tools and frameworks, you can consistently produce documents that meet both internal expectations and regulatory requirements.</p>
      <p>The key is not to chase perfection, but to build processes that support quality from the very start. Because getting it right the first time might not always be possible, but it should always be the goal.</p>
      <p>When everything comes together, when the data aligns, the document flows, and the submission is accepted without question, there’s a distinct sense of pride that accompanies the moment.</p>

IEC 62366-1 provides a structured approach to ensure that devices are designed with the user in mind and that potential risks associated with their use are identified and mitigated.</p>
    <h2 id="what-is-iec-62366-a-crucial-standard-for-medical-device-usability">What is IEC 62366? A Crucial Standard for Medical Device Usability</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/63179.html">According to ISO</a>, ‘<q>IEC 62366 specifies a process for a manufacturer to analyse, specify, develop and evaluate the useability of a medical device as it relates to safety. The first edition of IEC 62366-1, together with the first edition of IEC 62366-2, cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC 62366 published in 2007 and its Amendment 1 (2014)</q>’</p>
    <ol>
      <li>IEC 62366-1 — Application of usability engineering to medical devices</li>
      <li>IEC 62366-2 — Guidance on the application of usability to engineering to medical devices</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This guideline provides medical device manufacturers with a structured approach to integrate human factors, supporting them in assessing, defining, creating, and testing the usability of their medical devices.</p>
    <h2 id="navigating-the-process-key-steps-in-writing-your-usability-file">Navigating the Process: Key Steps in Writing Your Usability File</h2>
    <p>What exactly should be included in a Usability Engineering File? How can you ensure that all the requirements outlined in the standard are met? What steps do you need to take to ensure compliance? These are common questions that many people face when beginning to create their usability files. By understanding the essential components and requirements, you’ll be well-equipped to develop a comprehensive Usability Engineering File that meets all necessary standards and helps ensure your medical device is both safe and effective for use.</p>
    <figure class="intrinsic">
      <img src="/assets/images/content/articles/inline/define-the-scope-of-your-usability-file.png" alt="A diagram showing the IEC 62366 process." loading="lazy" width="400" height="670" />
    </figure>
    <h3 id="step-1-define-the-scope">Step 1: Define the Scope</h3>
    <p>This encompasses the specific user group, the intended purpose, and the context in which the device will be utilised.</p>
    <p><strong>Intended Users:</strong> Who will be using the device? This could include healthcare professionals, patients, or other relevant parties.</p>
    <p><strong>Intended Use:</strong> What is the device designed to accomplish? This refers to the specific tasks the device is intended for, such as monitoring, diagnosing, or therapeutic applications.</p>
    <p><strong>Use Environment:</strong> Where will the device be used? The setting can significantly influence the device’s usability, whether it’s intended for use in a home environment or a clinical/hospital setting.</p>
    <h3 id="step-2-conducting-a-risk-analysis">Step 2: Conducting a Risk Analysis</h3>
    <p>IEC 62366-1 mandates that you perform a comprehensive risk analysis to identify potential use-related hazards—situations where user errors may lead to harm or malfunction of the device.</p>
    <p><strong>Hazard Identification:</strong> Identify potential hazards that may result from user errors or design flaws. For example, in a medical device like a ventilator, if the user interface is poorly designed, a healthcare professional could mistakenly adjust the settings, leading to inappropriate ventilation rates for the patient. This could result in either hypoventilation (insufficient oxygen delivery) or hyperventilation (excessive oxygen delivery), both of which could cause severe harm to the patient.</p>
    <p><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> Assess the likelihood and severity of harm associated with each identified hazard. This involves evaluating whether a specific user action could result in patient harm, an incorrect diagnosis, or delayed treatment, ensuring that risks are appropriately managed and mitigated.</p>
    <h3 id="step-3-define-user-interface-ui-design-requirements">Step 3: Define User Interface (UI) Design Requirements</h3>
    <p>Following the analysis of user needs and risks, the next crucial step is to establish UI design requirements tailored to the target user group. Chapter 5.2. requires you to identify, as part of the risk analysis, all parts and characteristics of the User Interface that are related to the safety of the medical device.</p>
    <p><strong>User Capabilities:</strong> Consider the cognitive, physical, and sensory abilities of the users. For instance, if the device is intended for elderly patients, ensure the interface is intuitive, with large text and simplified navigation.</p>
    <p><strong>Design Guidelines:</strong> These should focus on clear labelling, well-organised controls, alarms, and instructions for use (IFU). Specific adaptations may be necessary for certain groups, such as non-professional users or individuals with visual impairments.</p>
    <p><strong>Task Optimisation:</strong> Structure the UI to reduce the likelihood of user error. Important tasks should be straightforward to access and perform, eliminating unnecessary steps that could lead to mistakes.</p>
    <h3 id="step-4-formative-evaluations">Step 4: Formative Evaluations</h3>
    <p>The formative evaluation section involves the testing of early prototypes or even design concepts with users in order to identify any potential problems prior to the final design being confirmed and completed. Once risks are identified, this process will repeat until these are mitigated.</p>
    <p><strong>User Testing:</strong> Carry out usability testing with representative users to assess the device’s interface and interaction design. This could involve techniques such as cognitive walkthroughs, task analysis, and heuristic evaluations to identify potential issues and areas for improvement.</p>
    <p>Were critical use errors found? Are further product improvements necessary? If you have answered “yes” to either of these questions at this point, go back as far as necessary in the Usability Engineering process and iterate through it from this point on until no new and critical problems occur during use. If this is the case, you are ready for the last big step: performing the summative evaluation.</p>
    <h3 id="step-5-summative-evaluation">Step 5: Summative Evaluation</h3>
    <p>The goal is to prove that the medical device (and its Interface) can be used without unacceptable residual risks for users, patients, and third parties. The hazard-related use scenarios previously defined are tested.</p>
    <p>The summative evaluation focuses on validating the final design to ensure that the device meets the defined usability goals and operates safely and effectively in real-world conditions.</p>
    <p><strong>Final Usability Testing:</strong> Conduct usability testing on the final version of the device to confirm that it functions as expected and that users can interact with it safely. This typically involves more realistic use scenarios, which may take place in clinical or home environments.</p>
    <p><strong>Task Performance Metrics:</strong> Evaluate whether users can complete key tasks successfully, such as using the device without errors, interpreting information accurately, and following safety instructions correctly. These metrics help ensure the device’s usability and overall safety in practical use.</p>
    <h3 id="step-6-post-market-surveillance-pms-and-usability-monitoring">Step 6: Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) and Usability Monitoring</h3>
    <p>Once the product has been released to the market, ongoing monitoring of its usability is crucial. Post-market surveillance helps to identify any emerging issues or areas where improvements can be made.</p>
    <p><strong>Incident Reporting:</strong> Set up a system to collect feedback and reports related to user issues. This should include complaints, adverse events, or any usability failures encountered by users.</p>
    <p><strong>Usability Improvements:</strong> If usability issues are identified after the product has been launched, they should be addressed through iterative improvements or design updates to enhance performance and user experience.</p>
    <h3 id="step-7-compiling-the-usability-file">Step 7: Compiling the Usability File</h3>
    <p>The Usability Engineering File should provide a thorough and organised record of the entire usability process, from initial risk analysis and design specifications to testing and post-market surveillance. It is essential that the file demonstrates full compliance with the usability requirements of IEC 62366-1, showing that every step has been taken to guarantee the device’s safety and effectiveness.</p>
    <p>The file should include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The device’s scope and intended use</li>
      <li>A detailed hazard analysis and risk assessment</li>
      <li>Clear design specifications and user interface requirements</li>
      <li>Results from formative and summative testing</li>
      <li>A post-market plan for ongoing usability monitoring</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="your-path-to-iec-62366-compliance-key-takeaways">Your Path to IEC 62366 Compliance: Key Takeaways</h2>
    <p>The Usability Engineering process, as meticulously outlined in IEC 62366-1, plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. By closely integrating with Risk Management, this process helps manufacturers identify and address potential use-related hazards that could jeopardise user safety, patient health, or device performance. Effective implementation, alongside comprehensive documentation, is not only vital for regulatory compliance but also for minimising the risks associated with human error. Ultimately, the goal is to create devices that are intuitive, safe, and reliable and that can stand up to real-world challenges. Following the steps of the Usability Engineering process ensures that these objectives are met and that safety is prioritised in every phase of development.</p>

The requirements for performance evaluation are described within Chapter VI of the Regulation on <em>in vitro</em> diagnostic medical devices <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017R0746#anx_XIII">(EU 2017/746) (IVDR)</a> and supported by Annexes I, II, III and XIII.</p>
  <h2 id="understanding-performance-evaluation-what-you-need-to-know">Understanding Performance Evaluation: What You Need to Know</h2>
  <p>Chapter VI of the IVDR states:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“<em>A performance evaluation shall follow a defined and methodologically sound procedure for the demonstration of the following, in accordance with this Article and with Part A of Annex XIII</em>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>scientific validity;</em></li>
      <li><em>analytical performance;</em></li>
      <li><em>clinical performance;</em></li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/content/articles/inline/ivd-performance-evaluation-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="442" height="322" />
  </figure>
  <p>The clinical evidence derived from the <a href="/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/ivdr-consulting">performance evaluation</a> shall provide scientifically valid assurance that the relevant general safety and performance requirements (GSPRs) set out in Annex I are fulfilled under normal conditions of use.</p>
  <h2 id="a-closer-look-at-article-56">A Closer Look at Article 56</h2>
  <p>Article 56 of the IVDR refers to the GSPRs set out in Annex I, specifically relating to the performance characteristics described in Chapter I and Section 9 of Annex I. It also addresses the acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio, as outlined in Sections 1 and 8 of Annex I, which is based on the scientific validity, analytical performance, and clinical performance of the IVD. Annex XIII specifies how IVD manufacturers must plan, conduct, and document the performance evaluation.</p>
  <p>Manufacturers are required to establish a standard operating procedure (SOP) for IVD performance evaluations, ensuring that it covers the entire device lifecycle. The IVDR defines performance evaluation as a continuous process that closely interfaces with risk management, as referenced in Annex VII, Section 4.5.4, and Annex XIII, Section 1.1.</p>
  <h2 id="mastering-the-performance-evaluation-plan">Mastering the Performance Evaluation Plan</h2>
  <p>A device-specific Performance Evaluation Plan (PEP) must be prepared in accordance with Annex XIII, Section 1.1 of the IVDR. The PEP should outline the current state of the art in relation to the medical, diagnostic, and technology-related fields relevant to the device. It must also reference applicable standards, common specifications, guidelines, or best practice documents.</p>
  <p>The PEP should define the intended purpose and characteristics of the device, including the analyte or biomarker it detects, its intended use, target user, and indications for use. Additionally, it must outline how the device demonstrates compliance with the GSPRs through its performance evaluation. The plan should also briefly describe the methods used to assess the device’s analytical and clinical performance, benefit-risk considerations, and the Post-Market Performance Follow-up (PMPF) plan.</p>
  <h2 id="scientific-validity-explained">Scientific Validity Explained</h2>
  <p>Scientific validity refers to the association between the analyte measured by the device and the clinical condition or physiological state. This association is documented in a Scientific Validity Report (SVR). The SVR should establish the device as state-of-the-art and demonstrate its clinical benefit. It should provide evidence of the clinical background, the clinical condition, the significance of the analyte, currently-used diagnostic options, similar and/or equivalent devices, and recommendations from professional societies to support the IVD’s performance and intended use.</p>

  </figure>
  <h2 id="navigating-analytical-performance">Navigating Analytical Performance</h2>
  <p>Section 9.1 of Annex I outlines the analytical performance requirements. However, as it is not possible to anticipate all scenarios regarding device types and intended purposes, the responsibility lies with the manufacturer to provide a rationale for any characteristics that are not applicable to their device. <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/79868.html">EN ISO 18113-3:2022</a>, <em>In vitro diagnostic medical devices — Information supplied by the manufacturer (labelling) — Part 3: In vitro diagnostic instruments for professional use</em>, offers guidance on performance characteristics that should be included in the labelling for instruments. Analytical performance must always be demonstrated through analytical performance studies, either using existing data or generating new evidence.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/content/articles/inline/ivd-performance-evaluation-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="442" height="322" />
  </figure>
  <h2 id="clinical-performance-uncovered">Clinical Performance Uncovered</h2>
  <p>Clinical performance is the “<em>ability of a device to yield results which are correlated with a defined clinical/physiological/pathological condition or state following the target population and intended user</em>”. Clinical performance provides evidence of how effectively the IVD device delivers results, diagnoses, or guides treatment decisions. Annex XIII, Section 1.2.3 of the IVDR outlines multiple options for gathering clinical performance data to substantiate the clinical evidence of the device.</p>
  <p>For devices measuring analytes that are associated with a clinical condition that have medical decision points, clinical performance data is required and should form part of the clinical performance report (CPR). Typical clinical performance data could be diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, area under the curve, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value.</p>
  <p>For devices measuring analytes without clear medical decision points or for devices measuring analytes that are not (yet) associated with a clinical condition, clinical performance may be defined as correlation with a physiological state, or a justification for omission of clinical performance studies may be considered. Typical data presented in the CPR would be negative percent agreement and positive percent agreement.</p>
  <p>Demonstration of the clinical performance of a device is based on one or a combination of the following sources:</p>

  <h2 id="the-key-steps-in-crafting-a-performance-evaluation-report">The Key Steps in Crafting a Performance Evaluation Report</h2>
  <p>In the Performance Evaluation Report (PER), you will need to summarise all the results related to Scientific Validity, Analytical Performance, and Clinical Performance to demonstrate conformity with the relevant GSPRs for your device, as referred to in Annex I of the IVDR. In the PER, you should evaluate the clinical evidence in light of the current state of the art in medicine, technology, the intended purpose, and the device’s positive benefit-risk ratio.</p>
  <p> Annex VIII, Part A (1.3.2) of the IVDR outlines the specific components of the PER and specifies that it must include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the justification for the approach taken to gather the clinical evidence;</li>
    <li>the literature search methodology and the literature search protocol and literature search report of a literature review;</li>
    <li>the technology on which the device is based, the intended purpose of the device, and any claims made about the device’s performance or safety;</li>
    <li>the nature and extent of the scientific validity and the analytical and clinical performance data that has been evaluated;</li>
    <li>the clinical evidence as the acceptable performances against the state of the art in medicine;</li>
    <li>any new conclusions derived from PMPF reports</li>
  </ul>
  <p>PERs for Class C and D devices must be updated at least annually, whereas PERs for Class A and B devices should be updated as needed, although at least a three-year review cycle would be recommended. As this document is multi-disciplinary, it is crucial that the manufacturer organises the writing and maintenance of this document and fully integrates it into the infrastructure of the quality management system (QMS).</p>
  <h2 id="ensuring-ongoing-success-with-post-market-performance-follow-up">Ensuring Ongoing Success with Post-Market Performance Follow-Up</h2>
  <p>Post-Market Performance Follow-Up (PMPF) is defined in Part B of Annex XIII as ‘a continuous process that updates the performance evaluation’ and goes on to state ‘<em>with the aim of confirming the safety, performance and scientific validity throughout the expected lifetime of the device, of ensuring the continued acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio and of detecting emerging risks on the basis of factual evidence</em>’.</p>
  <p>PMPF essentially serves to continue supporting the PEP/PER throughout the device’s lifecycle and is particularly useful for monitoring scientific or clinical developments that may impact the device’s performance and safety.</p>
  <p>Outputs from PMPF are written in the PMPF evaluation report, where it is then determined if those outputs result in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An update to the associated performance evaluation documentation and a revision of the risk management reports</li>
    <li>A CAPA being raised</li>
    <li>Further PMPF studies being conducted</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="ensuring-ivd-success-key-takeaways-for-performance-evaluation">Ensuring IVD Success: Key Takeaways for Performance Evaluation</h2>
  <p>Conducting a performance evaluation for IVDs is a critical step in ensuring their safety, reliability, and effectiveness. By following a structured process—starting with understanding regulatory requirements, defining intended use, and conducting rigorous analytical and clinical testing—you can demonstrate that your IVD meets the necessary standards for market approval. Continuous post-market surveillance further ensures that the device continues to deliver value and contributes to better patient outcomes.</p>

    <strong>Transcript follows:</strong>
    <p>It’s Paul from Mantra Systems here, and welcome to episode two of our series on how to fix clinical evaluation non-conformances.</p>
    <p>If you didn’t see the first part in the series, I’ll put a link to that post in the description below this video.</p>
    <p>But otherwise, let’s get on with episode two.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Non-conformances following submission of a clinical evaluation are quite common under the EU MDR, basically because the standard for submissions is now so high.</p>
    <p>But the problem is that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Resolution of non-conformances is necessary for the clinical evaluation to be accepted.</li>
      <li>Nonconformities can be quite difficult to interpret.</li>
      <li>It may not always be clear how to fully address them.</li>
      <li>A failure to resolve non-conformances may lead to:
        <ul>
          <li>A further round of review,</li>
          <li>Increased costs,</li>
          <li>Lost time,</li>
          <li>Stress and worry.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The aim of this series is to work through commonly seen nonconformities one at a time, and dig deep into what they mean and how to solve—or preferably avoid—them in the first place.</p>
    <p>The context behind this is to link into general principles for optimal conduct of medical device clinical evaluation.</p>
    <p><strong>Nonconformity Number Two.</strong> The one we’re going to look at is this:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>‘Appraisal of literature articles has not been conducted appropriately.’</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is one we see a lot. To explore it—and ensure that you don’t fall foul of it—we’ve broken our approach down into three steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Consider what appraisal actually means and what purpose it serves within the context of a clinical evaluation.</li>
      <li>Look at the characteristics of an appropriate appraisal framework.</li>
      <li>Consider how appraisal should be applied during clinical evaluation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>What Is Appraisal?</strong> Appraisal is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>structured and systematic evaluation</strong> of:
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>quality</strong> of individual studies within a literature review or a clinical evaluation, and</li>
          <li>The <strong>relevance</strong> of each source to the clinical evaluation.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If applied correctly, appraisal enables <strong>systematic weighting</strong> of study outcomes according to quality and relevance.</p>
    <p>The basic idea:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The better the study, and the more relevant it is, the greater weighting is given to its results compared with lower-quality studies of lower relevance.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The MEDDEV guideline 2.7/1 revision 4—although somewhat outdated—places appraisal effectively into context.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clinical evaluation is split into four stages: 0, 1, 2, and 3.</li>
      <li><strong>Appraisal is stage 2</strong>, which:
        <ul>
          <li>Comes after identification of pertinent data,</li>
          <li>Leads into appropriate analysis,</li>
          <li>Emphasizes that you can’t properly analyze data until you’ve appraised it.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Designing an Appraisal Framework</strong>. There is <strong>no universally defined appraisal system</strong>. Some systems are <strong>broadly accepted</strong>, such as the Oxford scheme, but:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>These can be limited. For example, the Oxford scheme only considers study type, overlooking other relevant factors.</li>
      <li>Therefore, <strong>justification of your chosen method is key</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Appraisal should:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consider a <strong>range of factors</strong> related to study quality and relevance.</li>
      <li>Avoid being based on <strong>just one or two</strong> elements.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The most common pitfall: <strong>doing nothing</strong> with the appraisal.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The objective is to produce an <strong>appraisal score for each source</strong> that actively influences outcomes.</p>
    <p>This score becomes a <strong>mathematical weighting factor</strong> applied to results from individual sources.</p>
    <p><strong>Characteristics of a Compliant Appraisal Framework</strong>. There’s no universally accepted method, but an appraisal scheme may consider:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Study type</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>RCTs typically score higher than cohort studies or case series.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Sample size</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Larger sample sizes increase reliability and therefore the score.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Use of statistics</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Includes whether the study shows statistical significance.</li>
          <li>Well-designed statistical analysis increases score.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Length of follow-up</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Longer follow-up captures more of the clinical journey.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Devices used within studies</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Subject device: highest score</li>
          <li>Equivalent device: slightly lower</li>
          <li>Similar device: lower still</li>
          <li>Unrelated device: lowest score</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The key is <strong>justification</strong>—explain to the reviewer why your approach is appropriate.</p>
    <p><strong>Example Scoring Framework.</strong> In your <strong>appraisal protocol</strong>, you might use a system like this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Characteristics listed on the left</li>
      <li>Descriptions and alpha-numeric grading on the right</li>
      <li>Higher numbers = better scores</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A randomized control trial might be scored <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R4</code>.</li>
      <li>A case series might be scored <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R1</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can build a table with these scores and apply it to each study. This allows a study to be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Strong in one area,</li>
      <li>Weak in another.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This <strong>combined appraisal system</strong> accounts for nuance.</p>
    <p>To produce the <strong>overall appraisal score</strong>, add the numbers in each row.</p>
    <p>Example (hypothetical data):</p>
    <p>For ‘Jones et al’:<br />
      R3 (3) + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = <strong>12</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Applying the Appraisal.</strong> Once you have appraisal scores:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>List the studies and their appraisal scores.</li>
      <li>Add an outcome parameter (e.g., reduction in pain VAS).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To calculate the <strong>weighted mean</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiply the <strong>outcome value</strong> by the <strong>appraisal score</strong>.</li>
      <li>Example for Jones et al:
        <ul>
          <li>Outcome: 4.5</li>
          <li>Appraisal score: 12</li>
          <li>Weighted value: 4.5 × 12 = 54</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Repeat for each source.</p>
    <p>Then:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sum the appraisal scores: <strong>61</strong></li>
      <li>Sum the weighted values: <strong>226.7</strong></li>
      <li>Divide the total weighted values by the total appraisal scores:</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-math">Weighted mean = 226.7 / 61 = 3.72
</code></pre>
    <p>This gives <strong>greater weight to better quality studies</strong>, which is the essence of how appraisal is expressed in a compliant clinical evaluation.</p>
    <p><strong>Summary of an Effective appraisal:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses systematic methods to evaluate quality and relevance.</li>
      <li>Considers a range of factors.</li>
      <li>Produces a score to enable mathematical weighting of results.</li>
      <li>Must be:
        <ul>
          <li>Justified,</li>
          <li>Conducted according to a clear, advance plan.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Applies to literature for both:
        <ul>
          <li>Subject devices,</li>
          <li>State-of-the-art comparisons.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Recap of Episode Two: Nonconformity #2: Appraisal of literature articles has not been conducted appropriately</strong></p>
    <p>In this episode, we’ve:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Looked at what appraisal is and what purpose it serves.</li>

      <li>Looked at how appraisal should be applied during clinical evaluation and the effect it has on outcomes.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <p>Don’t forget that <strong>Mantra Systems offers a comprehensive clinical evaluation service</strong>. One of the most common reasons we’re engaged is to help with resolution of non-conformities.</p>

However, the reality is that meeting requirements isn’t always plain sailing.</p>
  <p>Based on our experience with over 250 successful submissions, we’ve identified that overcoming clinical evaluation non-conformities is one of the major challenges manufacturers face during the device approval journey.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-a-non-conformity-in-clinical-evaluation">What is a Non-Conformity in Clinical Evaluation?</h2>
  <p>A non-conformity arises when a CEP or CER fails to meet MDR requirements. Non-conformities signal that the evaluation does not yet adequately demonstrate a medical device’s safety and performance or that full alignment with regulatory obligations has not been shown, requiring correction before approval.</p>
  <h2 id="the-impact-of-non-conformities-on-manufacturers">The Impact of Non-Conformities on Manufacturers</h2>
  <p>Non-conformities significantly disrupt the approval process, leading to extended review timelines, increased costs, and mandatory revision cycles. Since notified bodies (NBs) cannot accept a CEP or CER with unresolved non-conformities, addressing them is critical for market access.</p>
  <h2 id="a-helping-hand">A helping hand</h2>
  <p>Our new video series applies our deep experience to help manufacturers proactively identify and fix these issues for smoother audits and faster certifications. This series breaks down the most common clinical evaluation non-conformities, explains <em>why</em> they keep happening, and most importantly, shows you <em>how to fix them</em> for good.

    <strong>Transcript follows:</strong>
    <p>Okay, hi everyone, it’s Paul here from Mantra Systems. Welcome to a brand new series that we’re running on how to fix <strong>clinical evaluation non-conformities</strong>.</p>
    <p>The idea behind this series is to equip you with the capability to, first of all, avoid common non-conformities that are seen in medical device clinical evaluations. And then secondly, if you have been unfortunate enough to receive one, by the end of the series you should hopefully have a powerful strategy for correcting them and moving on to full acceptance of your CE.</p>
    <p>So, just for this first episode, we’re going to cover a few basics, and it’s worth starting with the question: <em>What is a clinical evaluation non-conformity?</em></p>
    <p>Well, obviously, apart from Class I devices, clinical evaluation plans and clinical evaluation reports need to be submitted for review by a notified body. And a non-conformity — or NC for short — is when conformity with requirements has not been adequately demonstrated. A non-conformity requires correction and then resubmission of the CEP and CER. Resolution — certainly of major non-conformities — is necessary in order for the clinical evaluation to be accepted.</p>
    <p>So, it is a really important topic, and non-conformities under MDR are quite common. But the problem with non-conformities is that sometimes the questions — which is how they’re often manifest, it’s a question from a reviewer — they can be difficult to interpret. Sometimes it’s not clear exactly what a reviewer means, and it may be unclear how to fully address them as well.</p>
    <p>A failure to resolve non-conformities in full may lead to a further round of review following yet another resubmission, which is just multiplying costs, losing time, and it leads to stress and worry — because it is anxiety-inducing trying to get a clinical evaluation through approval.</p>
    <p>Okay, so the aim of the series is to work through common non-conformities one at a time, and to dig deep into what they mean and how to solve or avoid them. The series and the principles within it link over to general principles for optimal conduct of clinical evaluation under the MDR.</p>
    <p>So, let’s start with our first example non-conformity. This one is a really common one, and it states:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>“Safety and performance objectives do not appear to have specific and measurable acceptance criteria.”</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Breaking that down, we need to understand exactly what the question means and how to address it. It’s possible to break it down into the following bullet points:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What actually are safety and performance objectives?</li>
      <li>What in this context does “specific and measurable” mean?</li>
      <li>What are acceptance criteria?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And importantly, of course, it needs to go beyond just knowing what they are but: <strong>How do we derive and analyse them?</strong></p>
    <p>So, let’s begin with safety and performance objectives. What are safety and performance objectives?</p>
    <p>Well, these ultimately are benchmark values against which the device under evaluation will be compared. They are derived from the state-of-the-art literature review, which is an essential component of clinical evaluation.</p>
    <p>Technically speaking, objectives have two components. They’re derived of a clinical outcome parameter — which is a qualitative concept or type of outcome — and then attached to that, there will be a quantitative value that forms the actual objective.</p>
    <p>As per the non-conformity, safety and performance objectives must be specific and measurable. Now, that covers a lot of ground, so let’s take an example and break this down.</p>
    <p>An example might be of a completed safety — or in this case a performance — objective:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>“Increasing walking distance in meters at six weeks post-procedure of 61.46m.”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>You can see within this the two components: the “increase in walking distance in meters at six weeks” — that’s not a value, okay? It contains a number, but that’s just because we need to compare like with like. That’s not the actual objective.</p>
    <p>The clinical outcome parameter is a thing, a concept, something you might measure, something to which you might attach a value. And then the second part of it is the actual performance outcome, which is quantitative.</p>
    <p>These two things together constitute a specific and measurable safety or performance objective.</p>
    <p>So, how are these derived? Well, they’re derived during the analysis stage of a state-of-the-art literature review. We’re going to go on to a working example in a moment to show exactly how they are derived.</p>
    <p>Remember, a clinical outcome parameter is a “thing,” and you decide upon those by looking for outcomes that are seen in a comparable form across multiple sources within the state-of-the-art literature review. If you have four, five, six sources all reporting the same type of outcome, it’s a strong candidate for a clinical outcome parameter.</p>
    <p>In the state-of-the-art protocol, there should be a method for determining what constitutes a clinical outcome parameter. That, of course, would feed into the clinical evaluation plan.</p>
    <p>Safety and performance objectives then are weighted mean values attached to those parameters. As we’ve seen before, you need both parts.</p>
    <p>It’s worth at this point just reflecting on the principles of an effective state-of-the-art literature review. Because there’s no point producing state-of-the-art safety or performance outcomes that have not been derived properly.</p>
    <p>We’ll go into this in another video, but a state-of-the-art literature review requires:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a detailed protocol</li>
      <li>use of a validated method to define research questions and search terms (one such method is PICCO)</li>
      <li>a well-documented literature extraction process with recording and justification of all excluded sources,</li>
      <li>a structured appraisal — which is where we get to be very specific to the production of safety and performance objectives, and</li>
      <li>the analysis — which is where the actual objectives are produced.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But we cover that in a lot more detail in a separate video.</p>
    <p>So, let’s look at a working example of how safety and performance objectives are derived.</p>
    <p>Here is fictional data. Let’s say we’ve done a state-of-the-art literature review, and sticking with the same example, we found four publications that all reported a mean increase in walking distance at six weeks, and they all did it in a comparable way. Here are the mean values from each of those sources.</p>
    <p>How do we produce a weighted mean?</p>
    <p>You can see in the table that the way we’re going to weight it is by a representation of the quality of each of these studies, to ensure that greater weighting or prominence is given to results from higher quality studies. In order to do that, we need to produce an appraisal score.</p>
    <p>Appraisal scores — there are lots of different ways to do this. On the next slide we’ve got, again, a simplified fictional example of how to calculate an appraisal score. You might look at different aspects of the study: you might consider study type, sample size, the use of statistical tests and whether they were appropriate, and the length of follow-up. You’d probably in reality consider other factors as well, but for the purpose of this, this will suffice.</p>
    <p>You’ve perhaps seen this — usually these manifest as an alphanumeric code, and again, the meaning behind this code should be expressed in the literature search protocol, in the appraisal plan section. So this will all be mapped out.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, this enables the calculation of a numerical appraisal score for each paper, with a higher number representing a higher quality study. Then those values can be imputed back into the original table with all the other values being the same.</p>
    <p>Now we have an appraisal score by which we can weight the results from each study. That’s done fairly simply just by multiplying the actual result by the appraisal score. We do that for all of them to produce a weighted value for each study.</p>
    <p>But we’re not quite done there, because we need to calculate a weighted mean. That’s done by taking the sum of all the weighted values and dividing that by the sum of the appraisal scores.</p>
    <p>What we’re doing there is making the appraisal scores the denominator — they are the weighting factor that’s being applied across all studies. This means we achieve our objective of moving the weighted mean closest to the values of the highest quality studies.</p>
    <p>In this case, that means: 3872 / 63, which gives a weighted mean of 61.46.</p>
    <p>It’s always worth sanity checking these, but if you look at the plain mean values from each study and the appraisal scores, you’d expect it to land around the 60 mark — and that’s where it falls: 61.46.</p>
    <p>So, that’s a simplified example of how to calculate a weighted mean for the quantitative component of a safety and performance objective.</p>
    <p>Don’t forget, the non-conformity required that we produce safety and performance objectives that are specific and measurable.</p>
    <p>Let’s just reflect on what that means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Specific means unambiguous, clear, and would be consistently interpreted as meaning the same thing.</li>
      <li>Measurable means it contains a value — a quantitative value — against which another value from another device can be measured.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So we have this in this case. It’s clear that that is both specific and measurable, and that’s why we included reference to six weeks — to ensure we’re comparing like with like.</p>
    <p>That leaves us to consider the final aspect of the non-conformity, which was reference to acceptance criteria.</p>
    <p>An acceptance criteria basically defines when safety or performance of the device under evaluation are acceptable in comparison to state-of-the-art.</p>
    <p>What we’re doing here is setting out a means for comparing the device-under-evaluation outcomes with the state-of-the-art objectives for specified clinical outcome parameters. By now, all of these terms should have a meaning attached to them.</p>
    <p>So, the clinical evaluation plan needs to contain an analysis plan for how this comparison will be done. Suffice to say that the outcomes for the device under evaluation are calculated by weighted means using a very similar method that we used for the state-of-the-art objectives.</p>
    <p>And acceptance — this is the key part — acceptance can be defined as showing (statistically) that the outcomes for the device under evaluation are non-inferior to objectives derived from the SOA. We don’t need to show superiority — we’re just showing non-inferiority. That’s a key distinction.</p>
    <p>Let’s take a final example, then, working this through.</p>
    <p>We can see:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increasing walking distance (spelled correctly this time) of 61.46,</li>
      <li>and in this example there were some other clinical outcome parameters as well:
        <ul>
          <li>improvement in pain (VAS, a measure of pain score),</li>
          <li>and range of motion at six months.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have values attached to all of those. Then we also have weighted mean values for the device under evaluation.</p>
    <p>Remember, the job here is to determine whether the device under evaluation is non-inferior to SOA objectives.</p>
    <p>For the top one, it’s very easy, because a plain number comparison shows that the device under evaluation did better than the SOA objective. We don’t need to do any fancy tests — it’s obviously non-inferior. That’s a straightforward conclusion.</p>
    <p>But with the others, on a plain number comparison, the device under evaluation actually looks like it’s done less well than the state-of-the-art objectives. The important thing to understand here is whether that represents true inferiority, or whether these values are statistically non-different.</p>
    <p>For that reason, conducting a statistical test is relevant. Often a t-test is an appropriate test because it’s a comparison of means, and it generates a p-value denoting significance or non-significance of the difference between these values.</p>
    <p>Let’s say we conducted a t-test in this case, and these were the p-values that were derived. Generally, significance requires a value of less than 0.05 for the p-value. That’s not what we’re seeing here, and so these differences were non-inferior.</p>
    <p>According to our acceptance criteria, the device under evaluation has been shown to have appropriate performance in reference to state-of-the-art.</p>
    <p>So let’s go back to the original non-conformity:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>“Safety and performance objectives do not appear to have specific and measurable acceptance criteria.”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We covered:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>what safety and performance objectives are,</li>
      <li>how to derive them using weighted values following a state-of-the-art literature review,</li>
      <li>what “specific and measurable” means and how the outlined process generates specific and measurable objectives,</li>
      <li>and what acceptance criteria are and how to apply them — including through use of statistical testing.</li>
    </ul>

It is a systematic approach used to identify, address, and prevent the recurrence of problems.</p>
  <p>A CAPA is a structured process used to identify, resolve, and prevent the recurrence of issues within a system or product. It is essential for ensuring quality, compliance, and continuous improvement in various industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals in the UK. The CAPA process is typically broken down into three main phases: <strong>Identify Problems</strong>, where issues are first recognised and thoroughly assessed; <strong>Address Problems</strong>, where corrective actions are formulated and implemented to fix the immediate problems; and <strong>Prevent Recurrence</strong>, where long-term solutions and preventive measures are established to ensure that the issue does not happen again, ultimately enhancing the reliability and quality of operations.</p>

  </figure>
  <h2 id="key-terms">Key terms</h2>
  <p>Here are some key terms that all medical device professionals should acquaint themselves with:</p>
  <h3 id="nonconformity--a-deviation-from-a-specification-standard-or-an-expectation">Nonconformity = A deviation from a specification, standard, or an expectation</h3>
  <p>Nonconformity is the recognition of an issue that deviates from the expected outcome or requirement. These typically appear at the beginning of the process, during identification and investigation stages.</p>
  <h3 id="capa-trigger--a-predefined-condition-that-leads-to-a-corrective-or-preventative-measure">CAPA Trigger = A predefined condition that leads to a corrective or preventative measure</h3>
  <p>CAPA triggers can arise from various sources, both internal and external, and typically highlight areas where a product, process, or system does not meet specified standards or expectations. Examples of CAPA triggers include: customer complaints, audit findings, and adverse events or near misses.</p>
  <h3 id="root-cause-analysis-rca--a-method-to-identify-the-cause-of-a-problem">Root Cause Analysis (RCA) = A method to identify the cause of a problem</h3>
  <p>The goal of RCA is not just to address the immediate symptoms of a problem, but to discover and resolve the root cause(s) to prevent recurrence. It’s a critical component of the CAPA process, especially in regulated industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and quality control. Tools such as the 5 Whys, Fishbone Diagram, and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) can be used to facilitate RCA.</p>
  <h3 id="root-cause--the-main-reason-why-a-problem-has-arisenoccurred">Root Cause = The main reason why a problem has arisen/occurred</h3>
  <p>In any quality management or problem-solving process, identifying the root cause is critical because it allows an organisation to focus its efforts on eliminating the source of the problem, rather than just addressing its symptoms.</p>
  <h3 id="field-corrective-action-fca--actions-to-address-issues-identified-after-distribution">Field Corrective Action (FCA) = Actions to address issues identified after distribution</h3>
  <p>FCAs are typically initiated after a product defect, safety concern, or performance failure has been identified in the field, often through customer complaints, product recalls, or post-market surveillance data. They form an important part of the product lifecycle and help in protecting both the end users and the manufacturer’s reputation.</p>
  <h3 id="supplier-corrective-action-request-scar--a-request-to-a-supplier-to-address-the-problem">Supplier Corrective Action Request (SCAR) = A request to a supplier to address the problem</h3>
  <p>The SCAR process is used to communicate nonconformities, initiate corrective actions, and ensure that suppliers address the underlying issues causing defects or quality problems. It’s an essential tool in quality management systems. The purpose of SCAR is to improve supplier performance and prevent recurrence of issues that may affect the quality and safety of the end product.</p>
  <h3 id="capa-plan--a-documented-plan-for-actions-to-address-a-specific-issue">CAPA Plan = A documented plan for actions to address a specific issue</h3>
  <p>It begins with identifying a problem, conducting a root cause analysis, and implementing corrective actions to resolve the issue. Preventive actions are then put in place to reduce the risk of future occurrences. The plan also includes verifying the effectiveness of these actions, documenting the process, and ensuring continuous monitoring for improvement.</p>
  <h3 id="capa-review-board--a-group-that-is-responsible-for-overseeing-the-capa-process">CAPA Review Board = A group that is responsible for overseeing the CAPA process</h3>
  <p>The board ensures that identified issues are appropriately investigated, root causes are thoroughly analysed, and corrective and preventive actions are effectively implemented.</p>
  <h3 id="risk-assessment--the-process-of-identifying-and-analysing-the-impact-of-potential-issues">Risk Assessment = The process of identifying and analysing the impact of potential issues</h3>
  <p>In the context of CAPA, risk assessment helps determine the severity and likelihood of an issue reoccurring, allowing companies to implement appropriate actions to mitigate or control these risks. It plays a critical role in ensuring that corrective and preventive measures are effective and proportionate to the identified risks.</p>
  <h3 id="correction--action-to-fix-a-nonconformity-without-addressing-the-root-issue">Correction = Action to fix a nonconformity without addressing the root issue</h3>
  <p>Unlike corrective actions, which are aimed at preventing recurrence, corrections focus on resolving the current issue.</p>
  <h3 id="preventative-action-pa--actions-that-address-the-causes-of-a-potential-nonconformity">Preventative Action (PA) = Actions that address the causes of a potential nonconformity</h3>
  <p>This process involves analysing trends, risks, or weak points in the system and making improvements to avoid future problems, ensuring ongoing compliance and quality.</p>
  <h3 id="corrective-action-ca--actions-that-address-the-causes-of-an-existing-nonconformity">Corrective Action (CA) = Actions that address the causes of an existing nonconformity</h3>
  <p>This process involves investigating the issue, implementing changes to eliminate the cause, and ensuring that similar issues do not arise in the future.</p>
  <h3 id="verification--checking-that-a-solution-works-as-intended">Verification = Checking that a solution works as intended</h3>
  <p>Verification is the process of confirming that a product, process, or system meets specific requirements and functions as intended. It involves checking and testing against predetermined criteria to ensure accuracy and compliance before implementation or release.</p>
  <h3 id="validation--ensuring-that-a-product-or-a-process-meets-its-intended-use">Validation = Ensuring that a product or a process meets its intended use</h3>
  <p>Validation ensures that a product, process, or system consistently meets its intended purpose and regulatory requirements. It involves testing and documentation to confirm reliability and compliance with standards, ensuring product quality and safety.</p>
  <h3 id="effectiveness-check-voe--evaluation-to-confirm-the-success-of-a-capa">Effectiveness Check (VoE) = Evaluation to confirm the success of a CAPA</h3>
  <p>After implementing corrective actions, an Effectiveness Check ensures that the changes have successfully resolved the problem and that the same issue does not reoccur. This check typically involves monitoring the results over a set period, reviewing data, and evaluating the impact of the actions on product quality, performance, or process improvements.</p>
  <h3 id="disposition--decision-on-how-to-handle-a-nonconforming-product-or-situation">Disposition = Decision on how to handle a nonconforming product or situation</h3>
  <p>Disposition refers to the decision made regarding nonconforming products, determining whether they should be reworked, used as-is, scrapped, or returned to the supplier. These decisions are based on the severity of the nonconformity and are crucial for maintaining product quality and compliance.</p>
  <h2 id="mastering-capa-turning-terminology-into-action">Mastering CAPA: Turning Terminology into Action</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, understanding and navigating CAPA terminology is essential for ensuring compliance and driving continuous improvement within a quality management system. Familiarity with key terms such as root cause analysis, corrective actions, preventive actions, and effectiveness checks will help professionals make informed decisions, streamline processes, and avoid common pitfalls.</p>
  <p>By staying up-to-date with these critical terms, organisations can strengthen their CAPA processes, improve product quality, and enhance overall regulatory compliance. Empowering teams with the knowledge of CAPA terminology is a key step toward maintaining high-quality standards and ensuring the safety and efficacy of medical devices in the marketplace.</p>

  <h2 id="key-considerations-for-manufacturers">Key Considerations for Manufacturers</h2>
  <p>The <a href="https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/download/12f9756a-1e0d-4aed-9783-d948553f1705_en?filename=md_mdcg_2020_guidance_classification_ivd-md_en.pdf">MDCG 2020-16 rev.4 guidance</a> has significant implications for <strong>IVD manufacturers</strong> as it refines how devices should be classified under IVDR.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accurate Classification Criteria</strong> – The revision of examples under <strong>Rules 1, 4(a), and 6</strong> helps manufacturers correctly classify their IVD devices, reducing uncertainty. Manufacturers must <strong>review and adapt</strong> classifications, ensuring conformity with <strong>IVDR and notified body requirements</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>More Precise Risk Assessment</strong> – Manufacturers need to reassess whether their devices fall into a different risk class, impacting regulatory requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved Compliance with IVDR</strong> – The minor changes provide clarity but do not fundamentally alter the classification process. However, manufacturers should review their classification decisions against the revised examples.</li>
    <li><strong>Potential Impact on Notified Body Review</strong> – If an IVD device’s classification is affected by the updated examples or rationale, additional <strong>notified body consultation</strong> may be required for conformity assessments.</li>

  <p>A risk assessment is a process used to identify, analyse, and mitigate risk in the design and development process to enable the sale of safe and successful medical devices. <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/risk-management">Risk assessment</a> ensures that all potential hazards are identified and mitigated to protect patient safety. However, manufacturers often encounter mistakes along the way that can compromise the effectiveness of the assessment and delay product launch. To help you navigate the risk management process smoothly, here are the <strong>Top 5 Pitfalls</strong> to avoid during the risk assessment of your medical devices.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/content/articles/inline/5-pitfalls-for-risk-assessment.svg" alt="Diagram highlighting the 5 pitfalls for risk assessment." loading="lazy" width="498" height="552" />
  </figure>
  <h2 id="1-failing-to-identify-all-potential-hazards">1. Failing to Identify All Potential Hazards</h2>
  <p>To begin a risk assessment, a comprehensive identification of potential hazards that could arise at any stage of the device’s lifecycle should be conducted. This involves documenting known and foreseeable hazards related to the medical device, considering its intended use, foreseeable misuse, and safety characteristics. A significant pitfall occurs here when manufacturers underestimate these hazards, in turn leading to an incomplete risk assessment.</p>
  <p><strong>How to avoid this:</strong></p>
  <p>Ensure cross-disciplinary teams are engaged (e.g., engineering, clinical, regulatory experts). This will ensure a thorough hazard analysis. Consider all potential risks, including those related to device malfunction, misuse, environmental factors, and human error.</p>
  <h2 id="2-insufficient-documentation-and-traceability">2. Insufficient Documentation and Traceability</h2>
  <p><a href="/enable-ce-mark/online-video-training-courses/risk-management">Clear documentation</a> of the risk management process is required for regulatory authorities, e.g., Notified Bodies, to review. <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017R0745">Article 10 of the EU MDR</a> requires all manufacturers to establish, document, implement, and maintain a system for Risk Management. A frequent pitfall here is failing to maintain proper documentation of hazard identification, risk analysis, and control measures. This, in turn, will lead to non-compliance and delays.</p>
  <p><strong>How to avoid this:</strong></p>
  <p>Confirm that every step of the risk management process is documented in detail. Alongside this, you can use risk management tools, e.g., FMEA or risk matrices, to track the rationale behind each decision. This will allow for full traceability throughout the device lifecycle.</p>
  <p>Maintaining and updating a Risk Management strategy requires scheduled review and appraisal sessions to analyse system suitability. The clinical evaluation cycle offers an opportunity to assimilate Risk Management data collected and to re-perform a benefit-risk analysis of the device. Any updates or changes to the process must be reflected in documentation and disseminated across the organisation to ensure the changes are implemented.</p>
  <h2 id="3-underestimating-risk-acceptability-criteria">3. Underestimating Risk Acceptability Criteria</h2>
  <p>Determining whether a risk is acceptable or not is crucial in risk assessment. During risk evaluation, the manufacturer must assess estimated risks for each hazardous situation and check if they meet the criteria in the risk management plan.</p>
  <p>Setting inappropriate risk acceptance thresholds can directly impact both patient safety and product timelines. If the acceptable risk is set too high, the device may pose a significant threat to users, leading to potential harm or regulatory non-compliance. On the other hand, being too cautious and lowering the threshold could result in unnecessary design changes or delays in the approval process, even for risks that are statistically insignificant.</p>
  <p><strong>How to avoid this:</strong></p>
  <p>Risk acceptance should be based on both regulatory requirements and real-world clinical needs. The criteria should be proportional to the severity and likelihood of the identified risks. A low-risk device may have higher acceptable risk levels, while a high-risk device, such as a life-supporting medical device, must have stringent limits. Tools like risk matrices can help categorise and prioritise risks by their severity and probability, ensuring a rational and evidence-based approach to setting acceptability levels.</p>
  <h2 id="4-ignoring-post-market-risks">4. Ignoring Post-Market Risks</h2>
  <p>Many manufacturers place a significant emphasis on pre-market risks, neglecting the post-market risks that may arise once the device is in use by patients or healthcare professionals. The manufacturer must review all collected post-market information, focusing on safety relevance. This aims to identify unrecognised hazards not initially identified, hazardous situations with now-unacceptable estimated risks, and cases where the overall residual risk is no longer acceptable relative to intended use benefits.</p>
  <p><strong>How to avoid:</strong></p>
  <p>Ensure you incorporate a robust <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/post-market-surveillance-pms">post-market surveillance plan</a> into your risk management strategy. As well as this, make sure you set up systems to monitor and track device performance, adverse events, and potential hazards once the product is on the market.</p>
  <h2 id="5-neglecting-risk-control-and-mitigation-strategies">5. Neglecting Risk Control and Mitigation Strategies</h2>
  <p>The identification of hazards is just one part of the risk management process. The next critical phase is the implementation of effective risk controls, which is necessary to reduce identified risks to acceptable levels. Failing to implement effective controls or using controls that are impractical or inadequate is a common trap. This can lead to unresolved risks that may jeopardise patient safety, compromise device effectiveness, and increase the likelihood of regulatory non-compliance.</p>
  <p><strong>How to avoid:</strong></p>
  <p>To avoid neglecting risk control strategies, it’s essential to follow a structured approach that aligns with recognised best practices and regulatory standards. Here are some practical steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Start by prioritising the risks that need mitigation based on their severity and probability of occurrence.</li>
    <li>Evaluate the effectiveness of controls. This can include pre-market validation through clinical trials, in-vitro testing, and failure testing, as well as post-market monitoring to ensure that controls remain effective over time.</li>
    <li>For each identified risk, provide a rationale for the selected control, how it works to mitigate the hazard, and how its effectiveness will be measured.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="final-thoughts-mastering-risk-assessment">Final Thoughts: Mastering Risk Assessment</h2>
  <p>By carefully identifying all potential hazards, setting realistic risk acceptability criteria, and implementing robust mitigation strategies, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of regulatory setbacks and safety issues. A proactive and comprehensive approach to risk management not only protects patients but also streamlines the path to market, helping your device succeed in a competitive landscape. Remember, risk assessment is an ongoing process that requires constant vigilance and adaptation, so stay committed to continuous improvement.

Labelling includes written, printed, or graphic details on the device itself, its packaging, or accompanying materials such as Instructions for Use (IFU). Regulatory bodies require manufacturers to provide clear and accurate labelling to enhance patient safety, facilitate proper usage, and comply with international standards.</p>
  <h2 id="medical-device-labelling-standard-iso-15223-12021">Medical Device Labelling Standard: ISO 15223-1:2021</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/77326.html">ISO 15223-1</a> sets out requirements for symbols used in medical device labelling to communicate information about the safe and effective use of devices. The latest version, ISO 15223-1:2021, includes additional symbols to comply with the requirements of <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32017R0745">EU MDR 2017/745</a>.</p>
  <p>According to the ISO 15223-1 standard, medical device labelling symbols are organised into seven categories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Symbols related to the manufacturing process of the device.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Symbols indicating specific storage conditions for the device.</li>
    <li><strong>Safe use:</strong> Symbols providing information on the safe and proper use of the device.</li>
    <li><strong>Sterility:</strong> Symbols indicating the sterile condition of the device or instructions related to sterility.</li>
    <li><strong>IVD specific:</strong> Symbols specific to in vitro diagnostic devices.</li>
    <li><strong>Transfusion/Infusion:</strong> Symbols related to transfusion or infusion procedures.</li>
    <li><strong>Others:</strong> Symbols that do not fall into the above categories but are still relevant to medical device labelling.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Standardised symbols help manufacturers effectively communicate vital information to users, enhancing safety and reducing risks of errors or misinterpretation.</p>
  <p>Regulatory requirements mandate that devices must be clearly identifiable as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-product-medical-device-mantrasystems-fbjae/">medical devices</a>. The medical device symbol, in accordance with ISO 15223, can be displayed on the label to facilitate recognition and ensure regulatory compliance.</p>

    <img src="/assets/images/content/articles/inline/md-logo.svg" alt="Medical Device logo." loading="lazy" width="200" height="137" />
  </figure>
  <p>Additionally, manufacturers must adhere to labelling regulations outlined in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/guide-general-performance-safety-requirements-gsprs-mantrasystems-f69fe/">GSPR</a> 23.1(a) and GSPR 20.1(a). These guidelines specify that certain label information must also be included in the Instructions for Use (IFU), and any symbols used on the label may require an explanation within the IFU.</p>
  <h2 id="substances-specific-information">Substances Specific Information</h2>
  <p>The label must also specify if the device contains or incorporates any of the following substances:</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/content/articles/inline/substances-for-device.svg" alt="Does the device contain specific substances? decision diagram." loading="lazy" width="556" height="264" />

  <h2 id="label-marking-requirements-iso-204172021">Label Marking Requirements (ISO 20417:2021)</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/67943.html">ISO 20417:2021</a> defines a label as “written, printed, or graphic information appearing on the item itself, on the packaging of each item, or on the packaging of multiple items.” According to this standard, manufacturers must ensure that the device is marked with the relevant information, unless:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The size of the device does not allow for fixation of the information.</li>
    <li>The nature of the outer surface of the device does not allow for the information to be fixed.</li>
    <li>The omission of the markings does not negatively affect the benefit-risk balance as per <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/72704.html">ISO 14971:2019</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="packaging-and-sterility-requirements">Packaging and Sterility Requirements</h2>
  <p>Packaging plays an essential role in ensuring that medical devices remain protected during transport, storage, and handling. <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/70799.html">ISO 11607</a> specifies requirements for the development and validation of processes for packaging medical devices. Compliance with ISO 11607 helps demonstrate conformity with essential requirements. Similar to the FDA, the EU requires compliance with ISO 10993-1 for the biological evaluation of medical device packaging materials.</p>
  <p>EU MDR 2017/745 annex I GSPR, specifies the packaging requirements of medical devices. The requirements can be summarised as;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The packaging must protect the device and maintain its integrity, ensuring it remains sterile if applicable.</li>
    <li>Non-sterile devices must be packaged in a way that maintains their cleanliness and integrity.</li>
    <li>The packaging must be designed to minimise contamination risks during transportation and storage.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For sterile devices, the packaging must ensure the device remains sterile until the packaging is opened.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The sterile packaging of a device should include the following information:</li>
    <li>An indication to recognise the packaging as sterile.</li>
    <li>A declaration that the device is in a sterile condition.</li>
    <li>The method of sterilisation.</li>
    <li>Instruction to check the instructions for use on what to do if the sterile packaging is damaged or unintentionally opened before use.</li>

It classifies AI systems into four risk categories which are unacceptable risk, high risk, transparency risk and minimal to no risk.</p>
  <p>On 4th February 2025, the European Commission issued guidelines on prohibited AI practices established by regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (AI Act). The guidelines are important to organisations and businesses with AI systems in the EU and detail which AI practices are unacceptable.</p>
  <p>A summary of the eight prohibited AI practices, examples of AI systems to which they apply and systems that are out of scope are listed below.</p>
  <h2 id="prohibited-ai-practices">Prohibited AI practices:</h2>
  <h3 id="1-harmful-manipulation-and-deception---article-5-1a">1. Harmful Manipulation and Deception - Article 5 (1)(a):</h3>
  <p>AI systems that employ subliminal, manipulative, or deceptive techniques that distort behaviour and cause significant harm are prohibited.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Subliminal techniques:</strong> Examples include AI systems that use visual and auditory subliminal messages, subvisual and subaudible cueing and embedded images that can unconsciously influence users.</li>
    <li><strong>Manipulative techniques:</strong> Examples include AI systems that purposefully manipulate users through background audio or images to induce mood changes such as increased anxiety or mental suffering resulting in significant harm.</li>
    <li><strong>Deceptive techniques:</strong> Examples include an AI chatbot that impersonates a friend or relative with a synthetic voice leading to scams and significant harm.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="2-harmful-exploitation-of-vulnerabilities---article-51b">2. Harmful exploitation of vulnerabilities - Article 5(1)(b):</h3>
  <p>AI systems that exploit vulnerabilities due to age, disability, or socio-economic situations resulting in distortion of behaviour and significant harm are prohibited.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An example is an AI powered toy that encourages children to complete increasingly risky challenges for digital rewards and virtual praise, potentially leading to dangerous behaviour and physical harm.</li>
    <li>AI systems that use lawful persuasion rather than manipulation and that are not likely to cause significant harm are outside of the scope of Article 5(1)(a) and (b).
      <ul>
        <li>For example, an AI system that uses personalised recommendations based on transparent algorithms and user preferences engages in lawful persuasion.</li>
        <li>For example, a therapeutic chatbot that uses subliminal techniques to guide users towards a healthier lifestyle and to quit bad habits such as smoking is not likely to cause significant harm even if users experience physical discomfort and psychological stress because of the effort made to quit smoking.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="3-social-scoring---article-51c">3. Social Scoring - Article 5(1)(c)</h3>
  <p>AI systems that evaluate or classify individuals based on social behaviour or personal characteristics resulting in unjustified treatment are prohibited.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An example is an AI predictive tool that analyses taxpayers’ tax returns to select tax returns for closer inspection. The AI tool uses relevant variables such as yearly income as well as unrelated data such as a taxpayer’ social habits or internet connections to select individuals for closer inspection, leading to potential discrimination.</li>
    <li>Out of scope legitimate scoring practices include financial credit scoring systems which are used by creditors and credit information agencies to determine a customer’s ability to repay debts by analysing a range of financial data such as the customer’s income and expenses.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="4-individual-criminal-offence-risk-assessment-and-prediction---article-51d">4. Individual Criminal Offence Risk Assessment and Prediction - Article 5(1)(d)</h3>
  <p>AI systems that predict criminal behaviour based solely on profiling or personality traits, without objective human assessment are prohibited.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An example is a law enforcement authority that uses an AI system to predict criminal behaviour based on a personal characteristic such as age, nationality, address and marital status leading to unjust profiling.</li>
    <li>Out of scope AI systems include predictive policing systems which generate a score for the likelihood of criminality in different neighbourhoods based on previous criminality rates and other supporting information such as street maps, allowing law enforcement to identify areas that require additional police presence.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="5-untargeted-scraping-of-facial-images---article-51e">5. Untargeted Scraping of Facial Images - Article 5(1)(e)</h3>
  <p>Creating or expanding facial recognition databases through untargeted scraping from the internet or CCTV footage is prohibited.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In terms of the internet, if a person has published facial images of themselves on social media it does not mean that the person has given permission for the images to be included in a facial recognition database. An example of scraping images from CCTV is an AI tool that uses images from surveillance cameras in public spaces like airports and streets without consent.</li>
    <li>Out of scope AI systems include databases that contain facial images but do not associate them with identifiable individuals e.g. datasets used solely for training or testing AI models without any intent to recognise or identify the persons in the images.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="6-emotion-recognition---article-51f">6. Emotion Recognition - Article 5(1)(f)</h3>
  <p>AI systems inferring emotions in workplaces and educational institutions, except for medical or safety reasons are prohibited.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An example of ‘emotion recognition’ is an AI system that infers that an employee is unhappy, sad or angry to customers using body gestures, a frown or the absence of a smile.</li>
    <li>Out of scope are AI systems that infer emotions not on the basis of biometric data e.g. from written text and AI systems that infer physical states e.g. pain and tiredness.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="7-biometric-categorisation---article-51g">7. Biometric Categorisation - Article 5(1)(g)</h3>
  <p>Categorising individuals based on biometric data to infer sensitive characteristics like race, political opinions, or sexual orientation are prohibited.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An example is an AI system that categorises social media users by their presumed political orientation based on biometric data from uploaded photos to send them targeted political messages.</li>
    <li>Examples of permissible filtering include the categorisation of patients using images according to skin or eye colour which may be important for a medical diagnosis such as cancer.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="8-real-time-remote-biometric-identification-rbi---article-51h">8. Real-time Remote Biometric Identification (RBI) - Article 5(1)(h)</h3>
  <p>The use of real-time RBI systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement is prohibited with exceptions only for serious threats and criminal investigations.</p>
  <p>Safeguards and conditions for the exceptions (Article 5(2)-(7) AI Act) are documented in the guidelines which aim to ensure the responsible and ethical use of AI technologies while safeguarding fundamental rights and promoting trust in AI systems.</p>

  </figure>
  <h2 id="enforcement-of-article-5-ai-act">Enforcement of Article 5 AI Act</h2>
  <p>The prohibitions in Article 5 AI Act became applicable after 2 February 2025 and penalties, governance and confidentiality will apply from 2 August 2025.</p>
  <p>Market Surveillance Authorities are responsible for the enforcement of rules in the AI Act for AI systems including prohibitions. The AI Act employs a tiered response to determine penalties for non-compliance. This system is designed to ensure that the severity of the infringement is appropriately matched with the corresponding penalty. Non-compliance with prohibitions in Article 5 AI Act are classified as the most serious infringement and subject to the highest fine which can be up to EUR 35,000,000 or up to 7% of worldwide turnover for the previous financial year, if the offender is an undertaking, whichever is higher.</p>
  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>AI in healthcare, such as software as a medical device (SaMD), must be developed with stringent ethical standards to ensure patient safety and protection of fundamental rights. The guidelines remind developers and regulators alike of the importance of maintaining transparency and safeguarding against AI misuse. As the healthcare sector continues to integrate AI into medical devices, these guidelines will serve as a key framework for ensuring that AI-driven solutions prioritise the well-being of patients while promoting innovation and trust in the healthcare system.</p>
