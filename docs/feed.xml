      <p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/applying-unique-device-identifier-step-by-step-guide-mantrasystems-v7dqe/">Unique Device Identifier (UDI)</a> is a crucial element in the medical device industry, designed to enhance the traceability and safety of medical devices. Think of UDI as a sort of “digital fingerprint” for each device—a unique combination of numbers and codes that provide important details about the device, such as its model, manufacturing batch, and more. It’s like putting a <em>superpower</em> into your device packaging, empowering manufacturers, regulators, and healthcare providers to quickly identify and track a device.</p>
      <p>A UDI is made up of two core components:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/assets/images/content/articles/inline/breaking-down-the-udi.svg" alt="Diagram illustrating the UDI-DI vs UDI-PI split." loading="lazy" width="840" height="290" />
      </figure>
      <h3 id="1-udi-di-device-identifier">1. UDI-DI (Device Identifier)</h3>
      <p>This is the fixed portion of the UDI and uniquely identifies the model or version of the device. It’s used to identify the product at a high level, no matter where it is sold or used. The UDI-DI is assigned by the manufacturer and remains constant across all units of that particular device.</p>
      <h3 id="2-udi-pi-production-identifier">2. UDI-PI (Production Identifier)</h3>
      <p>The variable portion of the UDI includes critical details about the device, such as its serial number, lot number, expiry date, or manufacture date. This part of the UDI ensures the traceability of each individual unit, making it easy to track and manage the device throughout its lifecycle.</p>
      <h2 id="whats-the-udi-carrier">What’s the UDI Carrier?</h2>
      <p>The UDI carrier is the machine-readable version of the UDI that is placed on the label or packaging of the medical device. It’s typically a barcode or QR code—something that can be quickly scanned by healthcare providers, distributors, or anyone handling the device. UDI carriers make tracking the device in real-time much more efficient.</p>
      <p>There are two common forms of UDI carriers:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/assets/images/content/articles/inline/which-udi-carrier.svg" alt="Diagram showing which UDI carrier should be used for medical devices?" loading="lazy" width="744" height="309" />
      </figure>
      <p>In accordance with Annex VI, Part C, Section 4.1, the UDI Carrier – both the Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) and the Human Readable Interpretation (HRI) must be placed on the label, the device itself, and all higher packaging levels. However, Section 4.2 allows the UDI carrier to be placed on the next higher packaging level if space on the unit of use packaging is limited. Additionally, Section 4.3 states that for single-use devices of Classes I and IIa, the UDI carrier is not required on the individual packaging but must appear on the next higher packaging level (e.g., a carton containing multiple devices).</p>
      <h2 id="understanding-udi-and-eudamed">Understanding UDI and EUDAMED</h2>
      <p>Under the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/745/oj/eng">EU MDR 2017/745</a>, medical device manufacturers must submit UDI data to <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/eudamed">EUDAMED</a> for all devices that fall under the regulation. Here’s how UDI submission fits into EUDAMED:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Manufacturers must submit UDI-DI information for each product (or product model) to EUDAMED to ensure that it is tracked in the European market.</li>
        <li>UDI-DI Data: This includes the unique identifier for each device, along with essential details such as the device’s name, model, classification, and the manufacturer’s information.</li>
        <li>EUDAMED Registration: Manufacturers must first register in EUDAMED to begin submitting UDI-DI information. Only those devices that are subject to MDR or IVDR are required to be listed in EUDAMED.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="udi-format-explained">UDI Format Explained</h2>
      <p>In the HRI format, you can see the UDI-DI, which is the number after the (01). Each time you see the 01 between brackets, this means this is the placeholder for the UDI-DI.</p>
      <p>Then, we arrive at the UDI-PI part. As mentioned, this part can vary depending on the production characteristic of the product.</p>
      <p>You can identify some numbers in the bracket on the UDI-PI part. Let’s decode them. Each of these numbers provides specific information about the product:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>(10) is for the lot number</li>
        <li>(11) is for the production date</li>
        <li>(17) defines the expiration date</li>
        <li>(21) is the serial number.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example: (01)00827002005112­(17)000004(10)­1234(21)8234</strong></p>
      <p>All this information is dynamic and will have to change each time you have a new batch or a new expiry date.</p>
      <h2 id="the-basic-udi-di">The Basic UDI-DI</h2>
      <p>The Basic UDI-DI is an EU approach for linking devices to their regulatory documentation and it is intended to uniquely identify the product model throughout the entire life cycle of the product.</p>
      <p>The Basic UDI-DI is a primary identifier of a device model i.e. it connects devices with the same intended purpose, risk class, and essential design and manufacturing characteristics. It is also the main record key in the UDI database i.e. it connects all associated UDI-DIs in the UDI database with the information in other EUDAMED modules.</p>
      <p>You’ll have it on your:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Certificates (Notified Bodies)</li>
        <li>Declaration of conformity</li>
        <li>Technical Documentation</li>
        <li>Summary of safety and clinical performance</li>
        <li>Certificate of free sale (Article 60(1) of MDR)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This one does not appear on the packaging of the products. It’s really an invisible number for your customers and is used solely in administration.</p>
      <h2 id="decoding-udi-strategic-takeaways">Decoding UDI: Strategic Takeaways</h2>
      <p>In conclusion, understanding and implementing the Unique Device Identifier (UDI) system is crucial for ensuring the safety, traceability, and regulatory compliance of medical devices. By breaking down the components of UDI, such as the UDI-DI, UDI-PI, and their formats (AIDC and HRI), manufacturers can streamline their processes and meet both EU and global regulatory requirements.</p>
      <p>With the correct application of UDI, medical device manufacturers enhance transparency, facilitate recalls, and ultimately contribute to better patient safety and device management in healthcare systems worldwide.</p>

To ensure compliance, manufacturers must thoroughly understand the classification rules outlined in Annex VIII of the IVDR.</p>
    <h2 id="what-has-changed">What has changed?</h2>
    <p>A significant change for manufacturers with the <a href="/articles/ivdd-ivdr-ensuring-compliance-during-transitional-period">transition from IVDD 98/79/EC to EU IVDR 2017/746</a> is the shift in classification of <em>in vitro</em> diagnostic medical devices from a “list-based” system to a “risk-based” approach.</p>
    <p>Under the IVDD, devices were categorized into List A and List B based on specific medical conditions. Devices on these lists required Notified Body submission, while all others were considered self-certifiable.</p>
    <p>In alignment with EU MDR, classification of <em>in vitro</em> diagnostic medical devices is now risk-based and moves through a system of class A, B, C and D. This classification considers both patient risk and broader public health implications. To achieve this, the IVDR makes use of 10 implementation rules and 7 classification rules to classify <em>in vitro</em> medical devices (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/746/oj/eng#anx_VIII">Annex VIII IVDR</a>).</p>
    <h2 id="risk-categories-explained">Risk categories explained</h2>
    <p>The risk of <em>in vitro</em> diagnostic medical devices is assessed based on the potential consequences of an incorrect result or diagnosis.</p>
    <p>Class A is the lowest risk category. It includes general laboratory devices, instruments and specimen receptacles. Non-sterile Class A devices can self-certify for a CE mark, meaning that they do not have to complete the process of conformity through a Notified Body.</p>
    <p>Class B risk category is the default class for all <em>in vitro</em> medical devices which are not covered specifically by other classification rules. It covers devices which are considered to be lower risk to patients and to the wider population. Examples include self-testing devices for pregnancy and fertility, self-testing kits for blood cholesterol or glucose levels, and urine tests for white or red blood cells, or bacteria.</p>
    <p>Class C includes IVDs that pose a lower risk to the wider population but a higher risk to the patient if the test result is inaccurate. In these cases, a diagnostic failure could have life-threatening consequences, such as in tests for infectious diseases or cancer. This class also covers companion diagnostics and genetic screening. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-companion-diagnostics-what-you-need-know-iyche/">Companion diagnostics</a> are IVDs which provide information which is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug or biological product.</p>
    <p>The highest risk classification is Class D. This class includes IVDs which test for general life-threatening conditions, and more specifically, for highly transmissible infectious agents in blood and biological material, which may be transplanted or readministered into the body. These transmissible agents may also present a high risk to the wider population. Class D also includes IVDs for blood grouping and tissue typing.</p>
    <h2 id="consequences-of-the-new-classification-rules">Consequences of the new classification rules</h2>
    <p>A major impact of the new risk classification system under IVDR is that approximately 78% of IVDs now require Notified Body certification, a significant increase from just 8% under the previous IVDD1. Initially there was a backlog in conformity assessments due to the low number of IVDR designated NBs. However, that has been rectified to some extent, with 12 notified bodies designated for IVDR submissions as of October 2024.</p>
    <p>Results from a recent Notified Body survey2 on certifications and applications, performed by the European Commission, found that one of the primary reasons for IVDR application refusals of IVDR applications was “wrong qualification/classification of device”. This highlights the importance of understanding and implementing the classification rules of Annex VII of the IVDR prior to the production of the technical file.</p>

This document is intended to promote the development of safe, effective, and <a href="/solutions/regulatory-consulting-for-samd-software-as-a-medical-device">high-quality AI-enabled medical devices</a>.</p>
  <p>The ten guiding principles are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Well-defined intended use:</strong> AI-enabled medical devices must be designed and used to address clinically meaningful needs. This requires a thorough understanding of the device’s intended use, benefits, and risks throughout its lifecycle. Multidisciplinary expertise should be leveraged to ensure safety and effectiveness.</li>
    <li><strong>Good software engineering, medical device design, and security practices:</strong> It is vital to ensure robust software engineering practices are implemented throughout the product life cycle. This can be achieved by using validated quality management systems and quality assurance tools, as well as following strict data management and cybersecurity protocols. This also includes having well-structured risk management and design processes to ensure confidence in the outputs of the model.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/clinical-evaluation">Clinical evaluation</a> with representative datasets:</strong> Data collection protocols must ensure the datasets used for training, testing, and monitoring the AI model sufficiently represent the intended patient population, use environment, and inputs. This helps manage bias, promote generalisability, assess usability, and identify potential underperformance.</li>
    <li><strong>Independent training and test datasets:</strong> Training and test datasets should be selected and maintained independently of one another. All potential sources of dependence, including factors related to patients, sites, and data acquisition, should be considered and addressed.</li>
    <li><strong>Fit-for-purpose reference standards:</strong> Accepted methods for developing reference standards should be used to ensure that clinically relevant and well-characterised data is collected. The limitations of reference standards should be understood, and the rationale for their choice should be documented based on the device’s intended use and assessment of their suitability for the intended use environment.</li>
    <li><strong>Model choice and design tailored to data and intended use:</strong> The choice and design of the AI model should be evaluated and shown to be suitable for the available data and support the mitigation of known risks such as overfitting, performance degradation, and security risks. The clinical benefits and risks related to the product should be well understood and used to derive clinically meaningful performance goals for testing.</li>
    <li><strong>Assessment of human-AI interactions:</strong> Device performance should be evaluated within its intended use environment and clinical workflow, considering interactions with all users. Human factors like user skills, understanding of model outputs, potential for overreliance, device autonomy, and user error should be addressed for both normal use and foreseeable misuse.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance testing in clinically relevant conditions:</strong> Methodologically and statistically sound test plans should be developed and executed to generate clinically relevant device performance information independently of the training dataset. Considerations should include the intended patient population, relevant subgroups, clinical environment, use by the human-AI team, measurement inputs, and potential confounding factors.</li>
    <li><strong>Clear and essential information for users:</strong> All users (healthcare professionals, patients, etc.) must receive clear, relevant information about the product’s intended use, indications, benefits, risks, performance, and limitations. This includes details about the model’s development, data used, inputs, outputs, and user interface. Users should also be informed about device updates and have a way to report concerns to the manufacturer.</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring of deployed models and management of re-training risks:</strong> Deployed models should be capable of ongoing monitoring in real-world use with a focus on maintaining or improving safety and performance. When models are retrained after deployment, appropriate controls should be in place to manage risks of overfitting, unintended bias, or degradation of the model that may impact safety and performance.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>These guiding principles are a call to action for international standards organisations, regulators, and other collaborative bodies to further advance GMLP. Areas of collaboration include research, educational tools and resources, international harmonisation, and consensus standards to inform regulatory policies and guidelines.</p>

  </figure>
  <p>The IMDRF emphasises the importance of GMLP in the context of evolving AI technologies, particularly generative AI. Generative AI presents unique considerations and potential risks, such as the use of foundation models not under the provenance of medical device manufacturers. The regulatory science of measuring performance and characterising and detecting errors in these models is maturing to meet these challenges.</p>
  <p>As the field of AI medical devices continues to evolve, so too must GMLP and consensus standards. The IMDRF’s publication of these guiding principles is a significant step in promoting the safe and effective development of AI-enabled medical devices. Medical device manufacturers should familiarise themselves with these principles and incorporate them into their development processes to ensure compliance and maintain patient safety.</p>

This update, released in January 2025, provides critical clarifications and insights for medical device manufacturers, aiming to ensure accurate and consistent use of the EMDN system.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-the-emdn-and-how-does-it-affect-me">What is the EMDN, and how does it affect me?</h2>
  <p>The EMDN is a standardised system for classifying and identifying medical devices within the European Union. Introduced under Article 26 of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/745/oj/eng">Medical Device Regulation (MDR) (EU) 2017/745</a> and Article 23 of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/746/oj/eng">In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (IVDR) (EU) 2017/746</a>, the EMDN plays a crucial role in the functioning of the <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/eudamed">European Database on Medical Devices (EUDAMED)</a>.</p>
  <p>Manufacturers utilise the EMDN to register their devices in EUDAMED, linking each device with a Unique Device Identifier - Device Identifier (UDI-DI). Beyond registration, the EMDN is vital for device documentation, notified body assessments, post-market surveillance, vigilance activities, and data analysis. It serves as a key reference for all stakeholders, including patients, providing clear device descriptions and promoting transparency in the medical device market. The EMDN is reviewed and updated annually based on user feedback and practical use.   </p>

  <p>The updated guidance document features a restructured FAQ section with new questions addressing specific aspects of EMDN implementation and management. Some of the key areas covered include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>EMDN Code Assignment:</strong> The document emphasises assigning the most granular and terminal code available to each device in EUDAMED. It clarifies the use of multiple codes for devices with multiple intended purposes, particularly complex systems with diverse functions.</li>
    <li><strong>Handling Code Gaps:</strong> If an appropriate EMDN term is not available, manufacturers are advised to use the code extension ‘99’ (‘Other’) and submit a proposal for a new code. This ensures the EMDN stays current with technological advancements and evolving device types.</li>
    <li><strong>Annual EMDN Review:</strong> The update highlights the annual EMDN update cycle and the importance of timely updates to EUDAMED entries and related documentation. Manufacturers are encouraged to review the updated EMDN annually to identify any changes impacting their devices and notify their notified bodies accordingly.</li>
    <li><strong>Code Updates and EUDAMED:</strong> The guidance provides clear instructions on handling obsolete or split codes in EUDAMED. Obsolete codes remain visible for a period, allowing for a smooth transition, while split codes are archived and made publicly accessible.</li>

  <p>MDCG <a href="https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/de470384-e8be-45e7-a334-226757f8816d_en">2024-2 Rev.1</a> contains a detailed explanation of the annual EMDN revision process. The most important part of the process for manufacturers is the collection of requests step. EMDN users, including competent authorities, notified bodies, manufacturers, and other stakeholders, can submit requests for changes to the EMDN through a dedicated platform. The deadline for submitting requests for processing in that same year is 31st January.  </p>
  <p>These requests are then reviewed by the EMDN Technical Team (EMDN-TT) and the MDCG Nomenclature Working Group (NOM WG) over the course of the year before finally being published to EUDAMED by the end of the year.</p>
  <p>In addition to the annual update cycle, a pilot procedure for ad-hoc updates requiring expedited review has been introduced. This ad-hoc process is limited to new code requests and is only available to competent authorities and notified bodies.  </p>
  <h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-me">What does this mean for me?</h2>
  <p>This update underscores the importance of staying informed about EMDN changes and ensuring accurate EMDN code assignment for all medical devices. Manufacturers must proactively engage with the annual EMDN review process, participate in code update proposals, and maintain accurate device information in EUDAMED.</p>
  <p>By adhering to these guidelines manufacturers can:</p>
  <ul>

Replacing the In Vitro Diagnostic Directive (IVDD 98/79/EC), <a href="/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/ivdr-consulting">the IVDR</a> establishes more rigorous standards to enhance the safety, performance, and quality of in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDs).</p>
  <p>However, the transition from IVDD to IVDR can be complex and manufacturers of legacy devices must navigate a range of considerations to ensure compliance while adapting to the new regulatory landscape.</p>
  <h2 id="maintaining-regulatory-compliance-during-the-ivdd-to-ivdr-transition">Maintaining Regulatory Compliance During the IVDD-to-IVDR Transition</h2>
  <p>To facilitate a smooth transition, IVDD-compliant legacy devices may continue to be placed on the market until the following deadlines:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Class D devices:</strong> Compliance required by <strong>31 December 2027</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Class C devices:</strong> Compliance required by <strong>31 December 2028</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Class B and Class A sterile devices:</strong> Compliance required by <strong>31 December 2029</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These <a href="https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/dfd7a1c6-f319-4682-9bac-77bef1165818_en">extended timelines</a> aim to provide manufacturers with the opportunity to adjust to the IVDR. However, continuing to market legacy devices during this period is conditional upon strict adherence to specific requirements.</p>
  <h2 id="conditions-for-placing-ivdd-compliant-devices-on-the-market">Conditions for Placing IVDD-Compliant Devices on the Market</h2>
  <p>Legacy devices may remain on the market during the transition period only if the following conditions are met:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The device must remain fully compliant with the IVDD.</li>
    <li>There are no significant changes to device design or intended purpose.</li>
    <li>The device does not present an unacceptable risk to patient or user health and safety, nor to public health.</li>
    <li>By <strong>26 May 2025</strong>, the manufacturer must have implemented a Quality Management System (QMS) in accordance with Article 10(8) of the IVDR.</li>
    <li>A formal application must have been lodged with a notified body (as per section 4.3, Annex VII) for conformity assessment no later than the 26 May 2025 for Class D devices, <strong>26 May 2026</strong> for Class C devices, and 26 May 2027 for Class B and Class A sterile devices.</li>
    <li>The manufacturer must have written agreement with the Notified Body by <strong>26 September 2025</strong> for Class D devices, <strong>26 September 2026</strong> for Class C devices, and <strong>26 September 2027</strong> for Class B and Class A sterile devices.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Failure to meet these conditions will negate compliance under transitional provisions.</p>
  <h2 id="implementing-an-ivdr-compliant-qms">Implementing an IVDR-Compliant QMS</h2>
  <p>Having an IVDR complaint QMS in place is not just about meeting regulatory requirements; it is a proactive strategy to ensure the continuous safety and performance of an IVD in a competitive market. To meet IVDR requirements, the QMS must include the following elements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A strategy for regulatory compliance, including management of modifications to devices.</li>
    <li>Identification of safety and performance requirements and strategies to address them.</li>
    <li>Clear management responsibility and accountability.</li>
    <li>Resource management, including oversight of suppliers and subcontractors.</li>
    <li>Comprehensive risk management in line with Annex I, Section 3.</li>
    <li>Performance evaluation, including Post-Market Performance Follow-up (PMPF) per Article 56 and Annex XIII.</li>
    <li>Processes for product realisation, from design and development to production and service.</li>
    <li>Verification of <strong>Unique Device Identifier (UDI)</strong> assignments and consistent device information management under Articles 24(3) and 26.</li>
    <li>A robust <strong>Post-Market Surveillance (PMS)</strong> system, as outlined in Article 78.</li>
    <li>Effective communication with stakeholders, including authorities, notified bodies, and customers.</li>
    <li>Processes for reporting serious incidents and implementing corrective and preventive actions (CAPA).</li>
    <li>Monitoring, measurement, and continuous product improvement.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="an-ivdr-compliant-qms-for-legacy-devices">An IVDR-Compliant QMS for Legacy Devices</h2>
  <p>Manufacturers must ensure their QMS is aligned with IVDR regulatory requirements. However, for certain aspects outlined in Article 10(8), such as points (b), (e), and (f), a distinction must be made for “legacy devices”. For these devices, manufacturers are not required to have identified all relevant safety and performance requirements, implemented comprehensive risk management, or conducted a full performance evaluation. However, it is important to note that from the 26 May 2025, manufacturers must ensure that their QMS addresses how compliance with these requirements will be achieved for legacy devices, ensuring full alignment with IVDR standards.</p>
  <p>Manufacturers have a few strategic options for updating to an IVDR-compliant QMS. One approach is to establish a parallel QMS. This approach enables clear reference to the appropriate procedures and highlights the transition to the new system. For companies with complex, long-standing QMS, it offers the chance to streamline and enhance efficiency. However, this approach demands considerable effort to develop and eventually replace the old procedures.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, companies whose existing QMS already aligns closely with the new IVDR requirements might prefer to update their current system. While this option can be more efficient, it may present challenges in ensuring that certain QMS elements are applied consistently across all products.</p>
  <p>Despite the chosen approach, documenting the transition is critical, clearly defining which procedures apply, when they take effect, and which products they impact. This can be done either within the procedures themselves or through a separate project plan. In addition, comprehensive training is key to ensuring everyone involved understands and implements the new requirements effectively.</p>
  <h2 id="the-time-to-act-is-now">The Time to Act Is Now</h2>
  <p>As the transition deadlines approach, manufacturers of legacy IVDs need to act swiftly to remain competitive and compliant in the evolving European market. The IVDR represents a major overhaul of IVD regulation in the EU, but it aims to ensure medical devices are safer, more effective, and of higher quality. Manufacturers who embrace these changes and take proactive steps to comply will be better positioned to navigate the evolving regulatory environment, ensuring continued market access and patient safety.</p>

These changes aim to strengthen the PMS system in the UK, ultimately improving patient safety. In this article, we will provide a detailed breakdown of these changes and what they mean for you.</p>
  <h2 id="introduction-to-the-mandatory-pms-plan">Introduction to the Mandatory PMS Plan</h2>
  <p>One of the most significant changes is the mandatory requirement for manufacturers to <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/post-market-surveillance-pms">have a PMS plan in place</a>. This plan, which outlines the methods for gathering and analysing device performance and safety data throughout the device’s lifecycle, is a crucial component of the updated regulations.</p>
  <p>The PMS plan should include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Objectives of the PMS system</li>
    <li>Processes to gather information, ensuring comprehensive real-world data is obtained</li>
    <li>Methods of data analysis</li>
    <li>Processes for fulfilling <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/vigilance">vigilance reporting</a> obligations</li>
    <li>Links to preventive and corrective action as part of a risk management process</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Manufacturers must review the actions taken according to the PMS plan at regular intervals and document the review in a Post-Market Surveillance Report (PMSR) or Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR), as appropriate.</p>
  <h2 id="enhancing-patient-and-public-engagement">Enhancing Patient and Public Engagement</h2>
  <p>The regulations underscore the significance of gathering feedback directly from patients and the public. This inclusive approach ensures that their experiences and perspectives are considered.</p>
  <p>This includes obtaining feedback on the device’s usability and the adequacy of the instructions for use. Depending on the device type, manufacturers need to assess and document the extent to which this is relevant and achievable.</p>
  <h2 id="focusing-on-similar-devices">Focusing on Similar Devices</h2>
  <p>To improve signal detection, manufacturers must collect data on their devices across all markets and review publicly available information on the safety of similar devices offered by competitors.</p>
  <p>The regulations define similar devices as those based on the same or similar technology and with the same or similar intended purpose.</p>
  <h2 id="taking-preventive-and-corrective-actions">Taking Preventive and Corrective Actions</h2>
  <p>The regulations require manufacturers to take preventive and corrective actions to address potential safety or conformity issues with their devices. This includes cooperating with the Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on any actions taken.</p>
  <p>Preventive actions should be taken before the manufacturing process is completed, while corrective actions should be taken after the devices have been manufactured.</p>
  <h2 id="understanding-reporting-requirements">Understanding Reporting Requirements</h2>
  <p>Manufacturers must submit PMSRs or PSURs to the MHRA, depending on the device classification. The PSURs must follow a standardised format and be updated at set intervals.</p>
  <p>The PMSR or PSUR should provide a comprehensive and critical analysis of the device’s risk-benefit balance and include a summary of the analysis and conclusions from the review of the PMS data gathered since the last report.</p>
  <h2 id="incorporating-vigilance-reporting">Incorporating Vigilance Reporting</h2>
  <p>The regulations outline the requirements for reporting serious incidents, Field Safety Corrective Actions (FSCAs), and adverse trends to the MHRA. This includes specific timelines for reporting and the use of the MHRA’s Manufacturer’s Incident Report (MIR) form.</p>
  <p>A serious incident is defined as one that directly or indirectly led to, or could have led to, death or serious deterioration in the state of health of a patient, user, or another person.</p>
  <h2 id="communicating-field-safety-notices-fsns">Communicating Field Safety Notices (FSNs)</h2>
  <p>Manufacturers must communicate FSCAs to affected customers using FSNs. The FSNs must include Unique Device Identifier (UDI) information where available and be sent in a searchable format. The MHRA encourages manufacturers to host a copy of the FSN on their website for transparency.</p>
  <p>The FSN should clearly communicate the risk and the actions taken to mitigate it. Manufacturers should take reasonable steps to ensure that all affected end-users receive and understand the FSN.</p>
  <h2 id="fscas-outside-great-britain">FSCAs Outside Great Britain</h2>
  <p>If a manufacturer undertakes an FSCA outside Great Britain that affects the same type of devices supplied in Great Britain, they must notify the MHRA within three UK working days of the FSN being circulated, even if the devices in Great Britain are not affected.</p>
  <p>This requirement is in place to provide transparency and avoid confusion by clarifying why the FSCA does not affect the UK.</p>
  <h2 id="additional-important-changes">Additional Important Changes</h2>
  <p>The update also amends the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clarification of Important Terms:</strong> The regulations define key terms, such as “lifetime” and “PMS period,” to ensure consistency and clarity.</li>
    <li><strong>Reportable Side Effects:</strong> The regulations clarify the definition of reportable side effects to include any negative impact on the health of the patient, their care, or wider public health.</li>
    <li><strong>Self-Administered Treatment:</strong> The regulations clarify that interventions to prevent serious deterioration in health include self-administered treatment.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Errors:</strong> The regulations specify that use errors do not need to result in serious deterioration in health to be reportable; the risk of occurrence is sufficient.</li>
    <li><strong>UDI Information:</strong> The regulations require the inclusion of Unique Device Identifier (UDI) information in incident reports and FSNs where available.</li>
    <li><strong>Trend Reporting:</strong> The regulations require manufacturers to submit trend reports for incidents that are reportable individually, as well as those that do not meet the criteria for individual reporting.</li>
    <li><strong>Custom-Made Devices:</strong> The regulations clarify that trend reports are not required for custom-made devices.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The UK’s Medical Devices (Post-market Surveillance Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations 2024 represent a significant step towards strengthening the PMS system for medical devices. By clarifying requirements, enhancing patient engagement, and focusing on proactive risk mitigation, these regulations aim to improve patient safety and ensure the continued effectiveness of medical devices in the UK market.</p>

  <h2 id="what-constitutes-a-legacy-device-and-what-are-the-clinical-evidence-requirements">What constitutes a ‘legacy device’ and what are the clinical evidence requirements?</h2>
  <p>Legacy devices include all <a href="/articles/keeping-medical-devices-in-market-maintaining-ce-marks">devices previously CE marked</a> under the European Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC (MDD) or the <a href="https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/single-market/european-standards/harmonised-standards/implantable-medical-devices_en">Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive 90/385/EEC (AIMDD)</a>.</p>
  <p>The MDR states that for legacy devices “sufficient” clinical evidence is required to demonstrate conformity with the relevant General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs).</p>
  <p>MDCG 2020-6 offers guidance on demonstrating sufficient clinical evidence for legacy devices. It states that both MDD and MDR require the quantity and quality of clinical data to be sufficient to demonstrate safety, performance and the acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio: both the Directives and the MDR require clinical evidence to be robust and the conclusions derived from this evidence to be scientifically valid. The guidance also reports that “the level of clinical evidence required for the device under evaluation needs to be determined by the manufacturer and verified by the notified body. The level of clinical evidence shall be appropriate in view of the characteristics of the device and its intended purpose.”</p>
  <h2 id="clinical-evaluation-for-legacy-devices">Clinical evaluation for legacy devices</h2>
  <p>The clinical evaluation process under EU MDR 2017/745 requires clinical data to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Demonstrate conformity with the applicable GSPRs set out in MDR Annex I under the normal conditions of the intended use of the device</li>
    <li>Assess undesirable side effects and the acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For legacy devices, <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/clinical-evaluation">the MDR clinical evaluation process</a> relies on post-market clinical data and clinical data generated during conformity assessments under MDD/AIMDD. Devices previously CE marked under MDD/AIMDD are expected to have continuously collected evidence in line with evolving regulatory requirements and guidance. However, MDCG 2020-6 clarifies that clinical data from conformity assessments under the MDD may not necessarily provide sufficient clinical evidence to meet MDR requirements. Therefore, manufacturers should assess whether additional evidence is needed to comply with MDR standards.</p>
  <p>Sections of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/17522/attachments/1/translations/">MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4</a> that remain relevant under the MDR are listed in Appendix I of the document. Additionally, if clinical data from an equivalent device has been used, manufacturers must verify that these devices still meet the <a href="/articles/five-tips-for-making-a-medical-device-equivalence-claim-under-the-mdr">MDR’s equivalence criteria</a>.</p>
  <p>During the transitional period, legacy devices are not exempt from the MDR’s additional requirements, including those related to Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) and <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/post-market-clinical-follow-up-pmcf">Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF)</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="how-can-mdcg-2020-6-help-with-the-mdr-conformity-assessment">How can MDCG 2020-6 help with the MDR conformity assessment?</h2>
  <p>MDCG 2020-6 provides guidance on establishing or updating a Clinical Evaluation Plan for legacy devices; the minimum content for the Clinical Evaluation Plan is described in Appendix II of the guidance document.</p>
  <p>Guidance is also described for the identification of available clinical data including pre-market and post-market sources, appraisal of the clinical data with respect to the overall clinical evaluation, generation of new clinical data to bridge gaps and analysis of the clinical data to demonstrate conformity with relevant GSPRs.</p>
  <p>A list of the suggested hierarchy of clinical evidence is documented in Appendix III of MDCG 2020-6, ranked from strongest to weakest level of evidence.</p>
  <p>Listed as number 1 are “results of high-quality clinical investigations covering all device variants, indications, patient populations, duration of treatment etc”; however, it is acknowledged that clinical investigations may not be feasible or necessary for legacy devices with a wide range of indications.</p>
  <h2 id="when-must-my-legacy-device-conform-to-the-updated-mdr-assessment">When must my legacy device conform to the updated MDR assessment?</h2>
  <p>Under the timelines established by the MDR, the deadline for manufacturers to apply to a Notified Body for a conformity assessment and to have a compliant Quality Management System (QMS) in place was 26 May 2021. Additionally, manufacturers were required to have a formal, written agreement with the Notified Body by 26 September 2024.</p>
  <p>Transition deadlines for legacy devices depend on their classification:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For <strong>Class III custom-made implantable devices</strong>, the deadline for full MDR compliance is <strong>26 May 2026</strong>.</li>
    <li>For <strong>Class III and Class IIb implantable devices that are non-WET (Well-Established Technologies)</strong>, the deadline for MDR compliance is <strong>31 December 2027</strong>.</li>
    <li>For all other <strong>Class IIb, Class IIa, Class Is, and Class Im devices</strong>, the deadline for MDR compliance is <strong>31 December 2028</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The recent release of MDCG 2021-25 Rev. 1 provides crucial insights into applying MDR requirements to ‘legacy’ and ‘old’ devices in light of the extended transitional period from MDD to MDR.</p>

Understanding this concept under <a href="/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/ivdr-consulting">the IVDR</a> is essential for compliance and plays a pivotal role in advancing patient care and outcomes.</p>
  <h2 id="how-does-the-mdr-define-a-clinical-benefit">How does the MDR define a ‘clinical benefit’?</h2>
  <p>‘Clinical benefit’ of a medical device under <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32017R0745">EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745</a> is well understood. Article 2(53) defines ‘clinical benefit’ as the positive impact of a device on the health of an individual expressed in terms of a meaningful, measurable, patient-relevant clinical outcome(s). This ‘clinical benefit’ is the improvement that the patient is expected to experience as a result of the device when used as intended, either directly or indirectly.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-the-clinical-benefit-of-an-in-vitro-diagnostic-medical-device">What is the ‘clinical benefit’ of an in vitro diagnostic medical device?</h2>
  <p>The ‘clinical benefit’ of <em>in vitro</em> diagnostic medical devices (IVDs), as defined by <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32017R0746">the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR) 2017/746</a>, differs significantly from that of pharmaceuticals or therapeutic medical devices. However, it remains crucial to accurately understand the concept of ‘clinical benefit’ for regulatory compliance.</p>
  <p>Unlike pharmaceuticals or therapeutic medical devices, which directly impact a patient’s health by treating or managing a condition, IVDs provide critical diagnostic information that supports clinical decisions. For example, IVDs include tools like blood tests or sputum analyses that help healthcare professionals understand a patient’s condition. These results are combined with data from other diagnostic tools, such as physical exams or imaging, to guide decisions about the patient’s care. Therefore, the outcome depends on a combination of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions included in the broader management plan.</p>
  <p>As per the EU IVDR Article 2(37), ‘clinical benefit’ means the positive impact of a device related to its function, such as that of screening, monitoring, diagnosis or aid to diagnosis of patients, or a positive impact on patient management or public health.</p>
  <h2 id="how-to-provide-evidence-of-an-ivd-clinical-benefit">How to provide evidence of an IVD ‘clinical benefit’?</h2>
  <p>A ‘clinical benefit’ of an IVD can be evidenced through its clinical performance by the gathering of <a href="/articles/scientific-validity-reports-foundation-of-the-ivdr-performance-evaluation">performance data (both analytical and clinical)</a>. Through performance data, it can be shown how the use of the IVD within the diagnostic or management plan, can assist in the final outcome of the patient.</p>
  <p>An example of a ‘clinical benefit’ provided by an IVD could be the early detection of a disease. This allows treatment to be administered more promptly and effectively e.g. the detection of tuberculosis will accelerate the initiation of treatment, thus preventing or aiding the management of complications.</p>
  <p>An IVD can prevent the spread of disease by identifying patients with a disease which may have the potential to spread throughout the population. IVDs such a companion diagnostic will enable the identification of patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product. They can also monitor the treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of treatment adjustment for safety or efficacy.</p>
  <h2 id="in-summary">In summary</h2>
  <p>The ‘clinical benefit’ of an IVD is its ability to provide accurate medical information that directly influences clinical decisions, whether for detection, diagnosis, or treatment monitoring. This value can be clearly evidenced through clinical performance data presented in the Clinical Performance Report (CPR) and Performance Evaluation Report (PER). By effectively showcasing how an IVD enhances patient management and public health, manufacturers can meet the EU IVDR 2017/746 requirements while reinforcing the vital role these devices play in improving healthcare outcomes.</p>

  <p>In this article, we explain how in two key areas these amendments reinforce important elements of the previously published regulatory framework, helping maintain the high quality and safety standards of medical and <i>in vitro</i> diagnostic devices.</p>
  <h2 id="1-gradual-roll-out-of-the-european-database-on-medical-devices-eudamed">1. Gradual roll-out of the European database on medical devices (EUDAMED)</h2>
  <p>This update requires that the Commission set up, maintain, and manage <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/eudamed">EUDAMED</a>, a framework comprising seven interconnected electronic systems. EUDAMED aims to provide better transparency and traceability of medical and <i>in vitro</i> diagnostic devices among EU member states. Four systems are complete to date, and two more are expected to be finished in 2024. The European Commission recently updated the <a href="https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/download/04ce2012-97df-4dd0-8a39-d4f6993b9e16_en?filename=md_eudamed_roadmap_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EUDAMED roadmap</a>, outlining key roll-out dates.</p>
  <p>However, the complexity of clinical investigations and performance studies poses a significant challenge, leading to delays in implementing EUDAMED across member states. As a result, EUDAMED will gradually roll out as individual electronic systems, with each system being implemented after thorough verification by the Commission.</p>
  <h2 id="2-ensuring-a-smooth-transition-to-the-ivdr">2. Ensuring a smooth transition to the IVDR</h2>
  <p>The transition from the EU Medical Devices Directive (IVDD) to the IVDR poses a challenge for <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/medical-device-manufacturers">manufacturers</a>, as shown by comparing conformity assessment applications and certificates issued by <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/notified-bodies">Notified Bodies</a>. With the transitional period ending on 26 May 2025, there is a high risk of shortages of critical <i>in vitro</i> diagnostic medical devices, especially high-risk (Class D) devices.</p>
  <p>Thus, the transitional period has been extended to prevent device shortages, protect patient health, and mitigate market disruption. This extension aims to provide manufacturers and notified bodies with the time necessary to complete the necessary conformity assessments. 
    As part of this, manufacturers must inform the relevant authorities of any perceived disruptions or discontinuation of medical devices that could harm patients or public health.</p>
  <h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>
  <p>These changes collectively aim to strengthen the regulatory framework for medical and <i>in vitro</i> diagnostic medical devices, improve safety and transparency, prioritise public health and foster medical device innovation.</p>
