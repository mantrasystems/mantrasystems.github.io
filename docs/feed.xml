Our experience working with clients across the industry has shown that many companies seek to save money by using purely retrospective data for PMCF submissions, or attempt to justify non-performance of PMCF when they should, in reality, have a system in place.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In this article, we move away from the purely regulatory benefits of engaging fully with PMCF and consider the wider benefits of a &lt;a href=&quot;/medical-device-regulatory-services/clinical-evidence-generation&quot;&gt;well-designed PMCF system&lt;/a&gt; to your business, your products and your relationship with your clients.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;pmcf-benefits-your-business&quot;&gt;PMCF benefits your business&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Generating clinical data is expensive. Prospective studies, in particular, can pose significant resource challenges because, by definition, they run for months or years at a time, consuming resources as they do so. The allure of using retrospective data for PMCF is therefore easy to understand from a business planning perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, consider the requirements for PMCF in Annex XIV Part B of the EU MDR. The Annex calls for &lt;strong&gt;continuous&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;proactive&lt;/strong&gt; data collection &lt;strong&gt;throughout the entire commercial lifetime of a device&lt;/strong&gt;. In practical terms, achieving the latter criterion will be almost impossible with retrospective data; it would require repeated studies over time with one following immediately upon another. This, in turn, would require repeated investment, time, resource, approvals, documentation, statistical analysis and reporting. While using retrospective data may be attractive in the short term, in reality it may simply be compounding problems for the business’ future.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A better approach would be a single investment in a well-designed and future-proofed dedicated prospective PMCF study. Once set up, this single system could collect data on the safety and performance of a medical device or product family indefinitely, fulfilling the Annex XIV criteria in a single swoop. This would also prevent the need for constant updating of documents and repeated passage through study approval processes. From a business perspective, it becomes easier to estimate resource requirements into the future with less duplication and wastage of time and money.
        Investing in a good-quality PMCF system for your devices can help safeguard both their regulatory approvals and your business over the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;pmcf-engages-your-customers&quot;&gt;PMCF engages your customers&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A further benefit provided by any well-designed PMCF system is the opportunity it provides for a further source of engagement with your customers. A change of emphasis from a “box ticking data collection exercise” to an opportunity to work collaboratively in promoting device safety is only one aspect of how PMCF can bring you and your customers closer together.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In particular, medical device PMCF registries call for close co-operation between customers (investigators) and manufacturer. Initial conversations about study participation, on-boarding processes, compliant remuneration frameworks, collating data and overcoming study-related challenges all provide important touch-points between manufacturer and customer, strengthening the sense of familiarity and co-operative working.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the act of selecting a clinical site may help them to feel valued and appreciated, cementing a positive relationship and, in turn, perception of your products and you as a company.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Customer relationships must be handled sensitively in relation to all forms of clinical study and PMCF is no exception. In particular, study participation must in no way act as an inducement to buy or use the product. And, as with all clinical studies, challenges will arise from time-to-time that may strain relationships. However, the right approach from the outset can more than overcome any such challenges and companies that build a network of satisfied customers actively engaging in their PMCF activities stand to secure both their customer relations and their regulatory approval both now and well into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

As a result of these changes, many manufacturers of established products have been left wondering whether they need to develop PMCF systems for their medical devices.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In this article, we outline why even long-standing legacy medical devices may need a PMCF system under the MDR. We also set out a range of reasons why PMCF could be avoided if a device meets a set range of criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For advice on developing PMCF systems for your devices, &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&gt;contact the friendly Mantra Systems team for a free, no-obligation discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;i-have-a-well-established-legacy-device---surely-i-dont-need-a-pmcf-system&quot;&gt;“I have a well-established legacy device - surely I don’t need a PMCF system?”&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Legacy devices with a long clinical history would seem unlikely candidates for needing a PMCF system. After all, it could justifiably be argued that a long, successful clinical history stands as plentiful evidence of a device’s safety and suitability for purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If an established legacy device has been entirely consistent throughout its history without undergoing any substantial changes in indication, intended purpose or patient population, then it is indeed possible that an exemption to PMCF could be successfully argued. In fact, long-standing devices unchanged through their commercial journey are the least likely of all devices to need a dedicated PMCF study.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;exceptions&quot;&gt;Exceptions&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are exceptions, however, that could mean a legacy device would still need to produce PMCF data on an ongoing basis, no matter how well established:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;It is a high-risk device (high risk classification, vulnerable patient population, device incorporates dangerous substances)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;There have been changes to the device’s indications, target patient populations, IFU, labelling or packaging since original CE-marking&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Novel changes have been introduced to the design of the device&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Clinical data is very old and has not been updated for some time&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Risk management and/or PMS activities have led to safety or performance questions relating to the device or to similar devices on the market&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A regulatory body has advised that a PMCF system needs to be in place&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If any of these criteria apply to your device, the chances are that a PMCF system will need to be developed to ensure ongoing regulatory approval. Contact our team for personalised advice on how to design product-specific PMCF systems for legacy devices.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;my-device-is-a-low-risk-class-i-device&quot;&gt;“My device is a low-risk Class I device”&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The applicability of PMCF to Class I devices can be understood by considering the main reasons for performing PMCF on any device under the MDR.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;figure class=&quot;expanded&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/content/guide/post-market-clinical-follow-up-process.png&quot; alt=&quot;The continuous clinical evidence collection process in Post-Market Clinical Follow-up&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig 1:&lt;/b&gt; The continuous clinical evidence collection process in Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Principal objectives of PMCF include:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Collecting data on new or existing side effects&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Monitoring for adverse events relating to use of the device&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Monitoring for systematic misuse of the device in practice&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Detecting any emergent risks that have not been considered in the device’s risk management activities, and harvesting data on the frequency and severity of harms identified in existing risk management documentation&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Collecting ongoing information about the safety and performance of the device in normal use&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Even a Class I device would normally be expected to exhibit side effects and risks, and all such devices must have a risk management system as part of their regulatory framework. Unless very well established as a legacy device, in many cases it will therefore be necessary for Class I device manufacturers to ensure that PMCF systems are in place for their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This considered, it is certainly worth making the point that not all PMCF systems are equal - and nor should they be. While a Class III implantable device may require a sophisticated medical device product registry for their PMCF activities, a simple Class I product could be served by a much less complex (but well-designed) PMCF survey which would be far less expensive and easier to implement in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ensuring suitability of PMCF system design for purpose is a core feature of our PMCF design service. Save money, time and resource by working with our team of experts when producing PMCF systems for your devices.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;my-device-is-supported-by-rcts-showing-that-it-is-safe-and-performs-as-intended&quot;&gt;“My device is supported by RCTs showing that it is safe and performs as intended”&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)&lt;/b&gt; represent one of the highest levels of clinical evidence. Manufacturers of products supported by high-quality clinical evidence such as RCTs or systematic reviews may feel that a PMCF study producing “inferior” evidence is therefore an unnecessary waste of resources.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The reasons this argument may be unsuccessful is that PMCF data is not ‘inferior’ to RCT data; rather, it has a different function and generates a different type of evidence to level I studies like RCTs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;RCTs, by definition, involve randomisation of subjects into one of two or more groups. By defintion, therefore, RCTs are comparative in nature. Furthermore, part of the power of RCTs comes from making the different groups as comparable as possible, which in turn calls for stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria for use when recruiting subjects into the study. The outcome of RCTs is accordingly ‘clean’ data that enables a valid comparison between groups.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMCF data is not intended to be comparative&lt;/b&gt;; rather, it should focus only on performance of the device in question. Furthermore, PMCF data should not be ‘clean’ in the sense of subject recruitment being driven by strict inclusion/exclusion criteria. Ideally, a PMCF study should collect real world evidence on the safety and performance of a device in actual clinical use, outside the inclusion/exclusion constraints of a formal RCT study. To take an obvious example: a RCT would (by definition) be unable to collect data on systematic misuse of a device, whereas a well-designed PMCF study should include provision for collecting (but not encouraging) instances of systematic misuse as a component of its design. Finally, RCTs collect high-quality data over a limited period of time while PMCF should collect targeted data throughout the entire clinical lifetime of a device, fulfilling an entirely different clinical purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Overall, the existence of robust RCTs does not automatically mean that PMCF will not be required. If in doubt, a free discussion with a member of our team may help you decide whether or not PMCF will be needed for your device.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Despite the increased focus and importance of PMCF under the EU MDR, there do remain legitimate justifications for not implementing PMCF in certain circumstances. In practice, though, these occasions are limited to well-established low-risk devices that are essentially unchanged since initial CE-marking and have demonstrated no alteration in risk profile since launch. Additionally, non-performance of PMCF would not normally be justified in the absence of any recent clinical data or where evidence fails to address all indications or target groups for the device.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In practice, it may often be advisable to focus on effective and device-appropriate PMCF design than to undertake convoluted justifications for non-performance. However, a reasoned consideration of the applicability of PMCF to your device is an important part of planning your regulatory strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

PMCF calls for the ongoing collection of safety and performance data throughout the commercial lifetime of a medical device, generating evidence on real-life experience with the product.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Understandably, some manufacturers are unclear whether a PMCF system needs to be implemented for their device and may prefer not to develop one unless absolutely necessary. This is particularly the case for legacy products with existing data, or with low-risk devices for which development of a bespoke PMCF system may at first glance seem unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, exceptions to the requirements for dedicated PMCF systems under the MDR are limited. It’s vital that all relevant device characteristics are considered in detail before forming conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The UK’s departure from the EU — as well as the imminent full implementation of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745 — has led to different rules for the regulatory compliance of medical devices in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, and Europe. Given that many manufacturers either already sell in more than one of these territories (and many others plan to do so in future), it is imperative that companies understand how to most effectively ensure compliance of their products.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In this article, we show you how to ensure regulatory alignment of your devices in the territories relevant to your products. If you have any questions after reading this article, please feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&gt;contact a member of the Mantra Systems team&lt;/a&gt; who will be happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-position&quot;&gt;Basic position&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745 will be fully implemented in Europe on 26th May 2021. After this date, all medical device certifications in Europe must be obtained according to the MDR standard. The Medical Device Directive 93/42/EC (“MDD”) will no longer apply to new or updated certifications in the EU.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Because the MDR implementation date falls after the end of the UK’s transition period for leaving the EU (1st January 2021), &lt;b&gt;the MDR will not take direct effect in the UK&lt;/b&gt;. The (confusingly named) UK Medical Device Regulations (2002) (as amended) will continue to apply in the UK after 26th May 2021. Because the 2002 Act implemented the MDD into UK law, the MDD continues to be the ‘baseline’ legislative standard in the UK — not the MDR.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Therefore, while medical devices in the EU will continue to apply the CE-mark as a sign of regulatory conformity, the UKCA mark will apply to devices sold in the UK. In certain circumstances a UKNI mark will apply to devices sold in Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;transitional-arrangements&quot;&gt;Transitional arrangements&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A number of transitional arrangements have been agreed by the UK competent authority (the MHRA) to avoid disruption to market access and ensure ongoing medical device supply. These transitional arrangements are vital to understand since they enable manufacturers who sell in more than one territory to avoid unnecessary duplication of regulatory time and expense.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are different rules for Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;great-britain&quot;&gt;Great Britain&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The MHRA will continue to accept CE-marked devices on the Great Britain market until 30 June 2023.&lt;/b&gt; This ruling applies to devices that have been CE-marked under any of the following EU standards:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Directive 90/385/EEC on active implantable medical devices (EU AIMDD)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices (EU MDD)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (EU IVDD)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Regulation 2017/745 on medical devices (EU MDR)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Regulation 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (EU IVDR)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;After 1 July 2023, new devices placed on the Great Britain market will need to conform with UKCA marking requirements.&lt;/b&gt; UKCA marks may be used voluntarily before this date for CE-marked products, but this is not obligatory. All devices sold in Great Britain must be registered with the MHRA and be represented by a UK-based Authorised Representative.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If a device already has a valid CE-mark, it is not necessary to re-label the device with a UKCA mark until 1 July 2023 for placement on the Great Britain market. Devices can have both marks present on the labelling prior to 1 July 2023, and dual marking will continue to be accepted on the Great Britain market after 1 July 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Therefore: if you are a manufacturer who sells devices in both Europe and Great Britain (or intends to before 2023) then CE-marking your devices under the MDR represents the most appropriate course of action.&lt;/b&gt; This will ensure your devices can be sold in the EU after 26th May 2021 and in the UK (including Northern Ireland) until 31st May 2023 without further changes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;northern-ireland&quot;&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Different rules apply for placing devices on the market in Northern Ireland. Unlike in Great Britain, the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745 &lt;b&gt;will&lt;/b&gt; apply directly in Northern Ireland after 26th May 2021. A CE-mark is needed for devices placed on the Northern Ireland market and EU rules need to be met; the UKCA mark alone will not be valid in Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CE-marking for placing a device on the market in &lt;b&gt;both Northern Ireland and the EU&lt;/b&gt; will need to be in accordance with the MDR and will necessitate use of an EU-recognised Notified Body.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;However, for the purposes of accessing the Northern Ireland market without the EU market&lt;/b&gt;, a medical device manufacturer may choose to use a UK Notified Body rather than one based in the EU. In this case, manufacturers would need to apply the UKNI mark alongside the CE-mark for devices sold in Northern Ireland. The UKNI marking must not be used on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;I will sell medical devices only in Europe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case, the MDR is the appropriate standard to work to.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;I will sell devices in both Europe and the UK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MDR would continue to be the most appropriate standard since MDR compliance is obligatory in Europe after 26th May 2021 and CE-marks obtained under the MDR will be recognised in the UK until 31st May 2023. Devices sold in the UK must be registered with the MHRA and you will need a UK-based Authorised Representative.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;I will sell devices only in the UK (including Northern Ireland)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case you would have a choice. One option would be to work to the MDR standard and undergo a conformity assessment with an EU-based Notified Body. In this case the device would bear a CE-mark which would be recognised in both Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
        Another option would be to undergo a conformity assessment via a UK-based Notified Body. In this case your devices would bear a UKCA mark in Great Britain and both a UKCA and UKNI mark in Northern Ireland.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;I will sell devices only in Great Britain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case you could work to the MDD-equivalent standard and undergo conformity assessments from a UK-based Notified Body. Your devices would bear a UKCA mark which would not be recognised on its own outside Great Britain.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As can be seen, in most cases the MDR represents the most appropriate regulatory standard. Conformity to MDR standards offers the greatest flexibility in market access and limits the potential for unnecessarily duplicating regulatory submissions.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The structure and format of UK medical device legislation after 2023 remains an unknown at present. However, given the convergent evolution of medical device legislation throughout the world, it is highly likely that post-2023 rules will closely resemble those seen in the EU MDR.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether you are upgrading your existing regulatory structures to the new MDR standard or building fresh systems for a new device, meeting the demands of the MDR can be a challenge even for experienced regulatory specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Much of the challenge, however, comes not just from the work itself. The sheer volume of work required means that regulatory departments can feel severely under-resourced. So much time is required for every individual work element that it is commonplace for regulatory departments to exceed capacity and become entirely overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This can be a difficult problem to solve because there may be a recognition amongst management that the issue is temporary — once systems have been updated to the MDR standard, workload can be expected to reduce as it focuses more on maintenance than re-engineering. Coupled with a shortage of regulatory specialists in the marketplace, this makes permanent additional recruitment difficult in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-answer&quot;&gt;The answer&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The answer is to bring in outside consulting support. Expert medical device regulatory consulting services deliver MDR specialists who will lend direct support during MDR transition. By their nature, consulting services are intended to step in when needed and then to step away, making it an efficient and cost-effective way of meeting MDR transition requirements without needing to permanently expand your regulatory department. More and more medical device manufacturers are looking to specialist medical device consulting providers for the support they need during their MDR transition.&lt;/p&gt;

MDR Annex XIV Part B describes Post-Market Clinical Follow-up as:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class=&quot;general&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;a continuous process that proactively and continuously collects and evaluates clinical data on the use of a CE-marked medical device.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the MDR states that PMCF should relate to the intended purpose of the device and have the aims of:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;confirming safety and performance throughout the expected lifetime of the device&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;ensuring the continued acceptability of identified risks&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;detecting evidence of any emerging risks that were previously unknown&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In order to meet this diverse range of objectives, PMCF studies need to have a solid implementation strategy alongside a robust design. A key part of any PMCF implementation strategy must be a focus on ensuring high levels of data collection compliance, minimising gaps in datasets which could otherwise be held to be potential sources of bias.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;5-methods-every-medical-device-manufacturer-should-know-to-improve-their-post-market-clinical-follow-up-studies&quot;&gt;5 methods every medical device manufacturer should know to improve their Post-Market Clinical Follow-up studies&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Promoting high levels of data entry compliance is a challenge in conducting any clinical investigation. Given that PMCF is intended to run throughout a device’s entire lifetime, devising ways of increasing and maintaining investigator engagement is central to long-term success.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are five methods for keeping investigators locked in:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;1-simplicity&quot;&gt;1. Simplicity&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Keep it simple. Clinical investigations that try to collect too much data are cumbersome to work with. Investigators often have very limited time and are accommodating data entry around their other commitments, meaning that cumbersome studies cannot be consistently integrated into their working day. Keep it lean and focus only on the essentials.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;2-a-smooth-user-experience&quot;&gt;2. A smooth user experience&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Related to simplicity, choose your data entry system carefully. While most studies will now use an eCRF for data entry, not all interfaces are equally easy to work with. Ensure you work with a system that prioritises a smooth user experience and minimises the opportunity for frustration during data entry. It is also worth remembering that hospital-based IT systems may have limited power and are often part of a shared network, meaning that resource-heavy platforms may function poorly. It is also the case that data connectivity for handheld devices may be limited within certain clinical areas.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;3-effective-communication&quot;&gt;3. Effective communication&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Don’t leave investigators feeling as though they are operating in a vacuum. Keep in touch with them and ensure that heavy recruiters know that their efforts are appreciated. It’s also a great way to ensure that any “niggling” problems are resolved immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;4-reciprocal-benefit&quot;&gt;4. Reciprocal benefit&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;PMCF studies have obvious benefits for manufacturers, helping to maintain regulatory approval of their devices and collecting crucial evidence on device safety and performance. Effectively encouraging investigator compliance calls for a PMCF study that also offers benefits for the healthcare professional. Opportunities for publications, podium presentations, and participation in investigator meetings all help, along with facilitating use of the data for internal clinical audits and performance reviews and a fair remuneration structure. At the outset of study design, consult with prospective clinical investigators and gain a deep understanding of what most benefit them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;5-review-change-and-update&quot;&gt;5. Review, change and update&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Take the time to ensure that the study design is working effectively. Make changes in line with investigator feedback and let them know that their comments and ideas have been implemented. Reacting to investigator feedback not only makes them feel valued; it also helps ensure that the study is best aligned to the needs of those who use your devices in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Post-Market Clinical Follow-up is most effective when powered by comprehensive and complete datasets. Using the tips in this article will give your PMCF studies the best chance of meeting these objectives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="pmcf" /><category term="clinical-investigations" /><summary type="html">Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) is a vital component of any successful MDR compliance strategy.

        &lt;p&gt;The new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) comes into force in May 2021 and replaces the existing Medical Device Directive (MDD). The MDR is 100 pages longer and has a much broader scope than the MDD, providing many challenges in achieving compliance. Companies with existing or new products must fully comply with the MDR however, for many, understanding the MDR in detail is quite a headache!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In this podcast hosted by Kaizen Life Sciences as part of their “Life Sciences Leaders” podcast series, Paul (Mantra Systems CEO) discusses the MDR and how companies in the life sciences sector can break down the MDR into more manageable action steps.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether it’s generating, searching, reviewing, appraising, interpreting or reporting clinical data, medical evidence is at the heart of MDR compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, in the absence of a medical or scientific background, working with clinical evidence isn’t easy. With the increased complexities of the new EU MDR, medical device manufacturers need easy access to skilled professionals who are comfortable working with and generating clinical evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Medical doctors are increasingly recognised as being perfectly positioned to meet this requirement. Doctors are trained to work with clinical evidence from the early stages of their career. Furthermore, in many cases they have worked as clinical investigators on medical studies, meaning that they are better qualified to drive compliance with clinical investigation data entry.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Medical doctors also have a thorough understanding of the conditions that medical devices address, and have general clinical training that enables them to put diseases and interventions into context. In turn, this means that doctors are able to advise on pertinent data-points that can extract maximum value from Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) and other performance monitoring studies.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Another advantage of working with medical doctors for MDR compliance is that doctors are professionally trained to perform objective assessments of clinical information, resisting sources of bias. This professional objectivity is of huge value in meeting MDR requirements for performing clinical evaluation of medical devices. Engaging a suitably-trained medical doctor from outside your organisation demonstrates a commitment to regulatory objectivity that will be favourably viewed by Notified Bodies and other regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Doctors are also of value when trying to address any gaps in a medical device’s clinical evidence portfolio. An expertly-performed &lt;a href=&quot;/medical-device-regulatory-services/clinical-evaluation&quot;&gt;Systematic Literature Review&lt;/a&gt; helps ensure that no relevant data is overlooked, and can also help to minimise expenditure on clinical investigations to generate new clinical data.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In summary, doctors have much to offer in helping medical device companies meet MDR requirements. Whether you are looking to &lt;a href=&quot;/medical-device-regulatory-services/clinical-evidence-generation&quot;&gt;design PMCF studies&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/medical-device-regulatory-services/clinical-evaluation&quot;&gt;perform Clinical Evaluation&lt;/a&gt;, engaging a medical doctor can be hugely advantageous.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Unless you have spent time working with medical device legislation in the past, the idea that software could be a medical device may be rather unexpected — a medical device is perhaps more traditionally viewed as a hardware product. Nonetheless, it is the case. Software is increasingly capable of medical functions such as making or assisting diagnosis, interpreting medical data, forming a prognosis, monitoring disease progression, and many others. It therefore makes sense to regulate software in line with physical medical devices.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the introduction of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745, fully implemented from May 2021, expands the definition of medical device and makes it even more likely that software will fall under its jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Medical Device Regulation MDR 2017/745 represents the largest overhaul of medical device legislation in decades. The MDR introduces a wide range of changes including an extended definition of what constitutes a medical device. Following significant advances in the complexity and availability of software over the past decade, many types of medical software will fall within this extended definition and be subject to the full scope of the MDR.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So if you have a software product that performs a medical function, how can you determine if your software will be classed as a medical device? And what do you need to do to meet your obligations under the MDR?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;is-my-software-a-medical-device&quot;&gt;Is my software a medical device?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not all software associated with the provision of healthcare will be classified as a medical device. Medical device legislation is intended to apply only to software whose expected purpose is in line with the definition of “medical device” provided in Article 2 of the MDR. However, because medical software performs such a vast array of purposes across healthcare, working with the Article 2 definition can be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Understanding whether or not the MDR will apply to a product is a key first step in developing a product compliance strategy beyond May 2021. In this article we set out some basic principles that may help developers understand whether the MDR applies to their products.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;First of all, software must have a &lt;strong&gt;medical purpose on its own&lt;/strong&gt; in order to be classified as a medical device. This is important to consider with respect to ‘stand-alone’ software such as a diagnostic application, but even more important when software is an integral part of, or associated with, a hardware device. Determining whether or not software has a medical purpose depends partly upon the &lt;strong&gt;intended purpose specified by the manufacturer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Secondly, it is important to consider &lt;strong&gt;the extent to which medical value is added&lt;/strong&gt; to data entered into the software. For example, simple archive and retrieval software that stores serial blood sugar values without manipulating the data does not add real medical value and would not normally be classed as a medical device; whereas, if that same software highlighted worrying trends in the data and advised when a hospital visit may be needed, this is likely to be held as medical value and class the software as a medical device.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Direct autonomous medical actions performed by software are another factor that will draw a software product under the definition of a medical device. For example, an app that analyses skin rashes to make a diagnosis would clearly be classed as a medical device.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For the purposes of understanding whether or not an individual software product may be subject to the MDR’s rules, it may be helpful to consider several categories of function and purpose:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Basic support/admin software&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Simple archive and retrieval&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Archive, retrieval and modify&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Data interpretation, advice and/or call-to-action&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Independent ‘smart’ diagnosis/prognosis/analysis&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Mixed purpose/modular software&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Combined hardware/software&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Closed loop products&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Contraceptive support&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-needs-to-be-done-if-software-is-a-medical-device&quot;&gt;What needs to be done if software is a medical device?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If a software product is classified as a medical device, then the full range of provisions in the Medical Device Regulation 2017/745 (“The MDR”) will apply to the product. This will mean implementing a number of systems that may be unfamiliar to software companies, including:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;developing a Quality Management System&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;implementing a Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) system to monitor performance of the product&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;designing Post-market Clinical Follow-up and Vigilance systems as components of PMS&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;performing a Clinical Evaluation of the product and submitting a Clinical Evaluation Report (CER)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It will also be necessary to understand how to work with MDR Annex VIII to determine risk classification for the product, as well as learning how to use MDR Annex I that lists General Safety and Performance Requirements that must be adhered to for every product.&lt;/p&gt;
