        The Medical Device Regulation (MDR)
        <span>An introduction to MDR Compliance</span>
      </h1>

      <p>By 26th May 2020 every medical device manufacturer in the European market needs to ensure MDR Compliance of their medical devices.</p>

    <ol class="row info-blocks no-gutter">
      <li class="col col-4 two">
        <h2>Enhanced standards</h2>
        <p>From 26th May 2020, the MDR will be in full effect and MDR compliance will be mandatory for all EU-based medical device manufacturers. This will require them to meet the enhanced standards of the new legislation.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="col col-4 two pop">
        <h2>New requirements</h2>
        <p>The MDR introduces a range of new requirements for drafting technical documentation, as well as mandating a more comprehensive clinical evidence portfolio that supports safety and efficacy for every individual indication.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="col col-4 two">
        <h2>New challenges</h2>
        <p>Medical device companies are facing new challenges in meeting the requirements for MDR compliance. Claims of equivalence may fail and the need to evidence every indication places huge demands on evidence-generation systems.</p>

        <div class="col col-8">
          <h3 class="one">Why has the MDR replaced the Medical Device Directive (MDD)?</h3>

          <p>Although generally robust and relatively permissive of innovation, the MDD was considered to have numerous flaws in enforcing medical device safety, reliability and general product quality, exposed by notorious incidents such as <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/metal-metal-hip-implants/concerns-about-metal-metal-hip-implants" target="_blank">the metal-on-metal hip scandal</a>. Legislators were compelled to implement reform.</p>

          <p>The new MDR attempts to reduce the likelihood of future incidents of this nature by tightening the requirements for proving safety and effectiveness of all medical devices, regardless of how long the product has been on the market.</p>

          <h3 class="one">How will the industry be affected?</h3>

          <p>From an industry perspective, the most important changes are the need to provide evidence <i>"on an ongoing basis"</i> to support every individual indication, in parallel with the reduced capacity to claim equivalence to devices already approved for sale. Read a further <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-medical-device-regulation-what-s-44777/" target="_blank">detailed summary of the changes</a>.</p>

          <p>These changes mean that manufacturers across the industry face a significantly increased evidence-generation burden, meaning a potentially huge increase in cost to meet the demands for medical device compliance. In some cases, this may even challenge the commercial viability of a product.</p>

          <p>We are experts at navigating the requirements for MDR Compliance and will ensure that you have the systems in place to meet the demands of the new legislation. Uniquely, our team of in-house, specially trained medical doctors will bring medical expertise to your evidence generation and technical document requirements.</p>

          <p>Obtaining a medical device CE-Mark under MDR requires robust clinical evidence in the form of Real World Evidence (RWE), built from Real World Data (RWD). Generating RWE is difficult and resource-intensive. We will work with you to design and develop your real world evidence generation system to the highest level of legal and regulatory compliance.</p>

    <h1 class="divide">What is the MDR?</h1>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col col-6">

        <p>The introduction of the Medical Device Regulations EU 2017/745, commonly known as the MDR, sees the largest overhaul of medical device regulation in decades. From 26th May 2020, the MDR will be fully in force and all medical devices in the European Union will be subject to it.</p>

        <p>The MDR replaces the outgoing Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC (MDD) after a three-year transition period. Although generally robust and relatively permissive of innovation, the MDD was considered to have a number flaws in enforcing medical device safety, reliability and general product quality, exposed by notorious incidents such as the metal-on-metal hip scandal. [Insert "nofollow" Link] It was also unable to account for technological developments that have arisen since it was drafted, such as diagnostic software and nanomaterials. Legislators were compelled to implement reform.</p>

        <p>The MDR describes a detailed regulatory environment around medical device design, construction, manufacturing, marketing, surveillance, senescence and oversight. The MDR expands upon provisions in the MDD to increase demands in specific areas, detailed below. It is expected that these changes will dramatically increase the workload for the regulatory department of medical device companies. Key changes include:</p>

        <h2>Increased clinical evidence requirement for MDR</h2>

        <p>A more extensive clinical evidence portfolio will be required under the MDR compared with the MDD. Specific evidence will be needed to demonstrate that devices meet the general safety and performance requirements (SPRs) for every individual target indication.</p>

        <p>For example, if a device can be implanted in hands, feet and spine, under MDR it will be necessary to produce evidence in all of these three specific areas. Under MDD it may have been sufficient to demonstrate outcomes in just one indication, and then extrapolate the results to apply to remaining indications. Where insufficient evidence is available, manufacturers can expect to lose regulatory approval for use of their device in that indication, meaning potentially catastrophic commercial losses.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="/assets/images/content/landing/inline/clinical-evidence-requirement-mdr.jpg" alt="Increased clinical evidence requirement for MDR">
        </figure>

        <h2>MDR Equivalence</h2>

        <p>Equivalence is the process of 'pointing to' a device that has regulatory approval and claiming that the device seeking approval is sufficiently similar to the approved one to be considered equivalent from a regulatory perspective.</p>

        <p>Under MDD, successfully arguing equivalence markedly reduced the difficulty of obtaining regulatory approval. Under MDR, the extent to which equivalence to existing devices can be claimed has been much reduced. The manufacturer seeking approval must demonstrate free and total access to the approved device's technical files, along with a contract allowing for the same. This would seem rather unlikely to be granted if the approved device is manufactured by a competitor.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, even if approval is granted for technical file access, equivalence will be challenging to prove under MDR since it must be demonstrated in function, materials, application, safety and intent. Therefore, the overall scope for claiming equivalence is much more restricted than before.</p>

        <h2>Post-Market Surveillance</h2>

        <p>Detailed rules have been introduced into MDR to determine how ongoing safety and efficacy of devices will be demonstrated following their initial release into market.</p>

        <h2>Broadening of the definition of 'Medical Device'</h2>

        <p>Under MDR, many devices and entities that would not previously have been classified as a medical device are now within scope of the MDR.  Examples include software with a diagnostic purpose, such as apps that use artificial intelligence to aid diagnosis.</p>

        Every medical device legally marketed in Europe must demonstrate compliance with the MDR from 26th May 2020. Devices that have successfully met their regulatory requirements may display a CE mark and be commercialised within the EU.

        <p>Medical device regulation in geographical territories outside the EU is overseen by different bodies (eg the FDA in USA); however the criteria for compliance are often similar and there is a trend towards global harmonisation of standards. The UK position post-Brexit remains unclear but it may be strongly expected that alignment with EU MDR standards will be maintained.</p>

          <p>The CER is an essential component of every medical device regulatory submission. New regulatory obligations imposed by MDR mean it is more challenging to draft technical documentation. We are highly experienced in drafting CERs in accordance with MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev 4 and guarantee your CERs will be fully MDR compliant.</p>
