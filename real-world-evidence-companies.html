                <div class="col col-6">
                  <p class="intro">Real World Evidence (RWE) is clinical evidence obtained from Real World Data (RWD) - observational data obtained from real-world use of devices rather than formal clinical trials.<p>

<p>Unlike many other real world evidence companies, Mantra Systems provides dedicated expertise in producing real world evidence, which can otherwise be challenging to generate. WeÂ can advise on construction of robust data collection systems that are capable of harvesting data on an ongoing basis without introducing bias or variability.</p>

<p>Mantra Systems, in contrast to other real world evidence companies, also has expertise in developing data entry systems that are sufficiently user-friendly to allow clinicians in practice to enter data as a component of their standard practice.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways to generate Real World Evidence (RWE). Our objective is to ensure that our clients choose the method of real-world evidence generation that is right for them.</p>

<p>The choice of real world evidence generation method is driven by a combination of factors. Some of the factors to consider include:</p>

<ul class="disc">
  <li>market sector</li>
  <li>availability of external data sources</li>
  <li>product type</li>
  <li>available company resources</li>
  <li>time and criticality</li>
</ul>

<h2>Poor choices</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, medical device manufacturers sometimes choose sub-optimal real world evidence collection methods. This is why it is so important to scrutinise different real world evidence companies.</p>

<p>A poor choice of real world evidence generation methods may lead to an accumulation of problems over time, as weaknesses of either collection method or the data itself tend to compound as data collection is ongoing.</p>

<p>Manufacturers may also find that compliance of investigators to data collection standards is often far below that required by regulatory frameworks supporting MDR compliance. This is especially the case if insufficient attention is given to the choice of data collection method.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the wrong choice of real world evidence generation method leads to wasted time and money, and a critical problem remaining to be solved.</p>

<h2>Existing registries</h2>

<p>Some market sectors are extremely fortunate in terms of real world evidence. In some clinical specialities there are already external or nationalised registries that collect data on the performance of multiple products within a sector.</p>

<p>For example, the National Joint Registry in the UK collects real-world data on the performance of orthopaedic joint replacement implants. This is a rich source of real world evidence that companies can access to compile evidence for regulatory submission, and has the advantage of being consecutive, non-selective, and objective (ie administered by an external agent rather than the manufacturer of the product in question).</p>

<p>Other market sectors are not so fortunate. In the absence of such nationalised registries, manufacturers must find other ways to generate real world evidence.</p>

<p><b>Mantra Systems Ltd, unlike many other real world evidence companies, specialises in producing real world evidence generation systems that fulfil all requirements of real world evidence for MDR compliance submissions.</b></p>
