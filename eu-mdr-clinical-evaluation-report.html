              <h2 id="writing-a-clinical-evaluation-report-cer-for-the-eu-mdr">Writing a Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) for the EU MDR</h2>
              <p>A Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) is an important technical document that must be produced for every medical device under the EU MDR. A Clinical Evaluation Report details the process, findings and conclusions of clinical evaluation, and must be written in accordance with the rules for clinical evaluation in EU MDR Annex XIV Part A.</p>
              <p>The EU MDR — Medical Device Regulation 2017/745, fully in force from May 2021 — replaces the Medical Device Directive (MDD) and imposes a wide range of new regulatory requirements.  It introduces a new framework for the conduct of clinical evaluation and the writing of CERs, including the need for a more thorough analysis of clinical evidence relating to a device. Writing a Clinical Evaluation Report for the EU MDR is a specialised task that greatly benefits from the involvement of an expertly-trained medical professional.</p>
              <h2 id="what-are-the-requirements-for-producing-a-clinical-evaluation-report-under-the-eu-mdr">What are the requirements for producing a Clinical Evaluation Report under the EU MDR?</h2>
              <p>Article 61 of the EU MDR states that the Clinical Evaluation of each medical device shall be documented in a Clinical Evaluation Report that must form part of the technical documentation portfolio for the device. Annex XIV Part A expands upon this requirement and provides detailed guidance for performing a clinical evaluation, stating that the process must:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>be based on a documented plan</li>
                <li>identify all clinical data relevant to the device, whether favourable or not</li>
                <li>appraise clinical data in a robust way</li>
                <li>establish a plan for filling any gaps in the clinical evidence portfolio</li>
                <li>reach objective conclusions about the safety and performance of the medical device</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Although Annex XIV Part A outlines how to perform a clinical evaluation, it is comparatively light on requirements for writing a Clinical Evaluation Report. It states only that “the results of the clinical evaluation shall be documented in a clinical evaluation report which shall support the assessment of the conformity of the device.”</p>
              <h2 id="specialist-clinical-evaluation-report-services-for-the-eu-mdr">Specialist Clinical Evaluation Report services for the EU MDR</h2>
              <p>At Mantra Systems, we have a team of expertly-trained medical doctors who are specialists at writing CERs for the EU MDR. Because a CER is such a central component of regulatory submissions for every medical device, engaging the services of a CER expert who understands EU MDR requirements in detail can be a major step towards ensuring a successful MDR transition.</p>
              <h2 id="what-other-information-sources-are-available">What other information sources are available?</h2>
              <p>More detailed guidance on writing CERs can be found in MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev 4 “Clinical Evaluation: A guide for manufacturers and notified bodies”, an advisory document published by the European Commission. It provides a useful section on CER structure but the guideline has not yet been updated to reflect changes in requirements introduced by the EU MDR. Because of this, adherence to MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev 4 alone will not be sufficient to achieve EU MDR compliance and manufacturers will need to consult externally for additional advice in order to ensure that EU MDR requirements have been met.</p>
              <h2 id="what-happens-to-a-clinical-evaluation-report-after-completion">What happens to a Clinical Evaluation Report after completion?</h2>
              <p>Following completion, a Clinical Evaluation Report will be assessed as a component of the technical documents required by Annex II MDR to be submitted in support of the device. The procedure by which this assessment will take place will vary according to the risk classification of the device, with a greater degree of regulatory scrutiny being required for higher risk devices.</p>
              <p>Manufacturers of Class IIa, IIb and III devices must submit the CER directly to a notified body for regulatory scrutiny as a pre-requisite for achieving permission to affix a CE-mark to the device. The MDR outlines responsibilities for notified bodies in performing assessments of clinical evaluation reports, requiring notified bodies to have access to individuals with sufficient scientific and technical expertise to make a reasoned assessment of the CER.</p>
              <p>Ensure that your devices are supported by the technical documentation they deserve in time for the EU MDR implementation deadline. Our medical experts offer a professional EU MDR Clinical Evaluation Report writing service for medical device companies across the industry. Contact a member of our team today to discuss your requirements.</p>
