              <h2 id="real-world-evidence-for-medical-devices">Real World Evidence for medical devices</h2>
              <p>Real World Evidence (RWE) is clinical evidence generated from observational data on the real-world use of medical devices. Real World Evidence has become increasingly important following the enactment of the Medical Device Regulation MDR 2017/745.</p>
              <p>The MDR introduces enhanced standards for post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) of all medical devices, requiring that data be produced continually and throughout the entire lifetime of a device. Implementing a PMCF system that generates Real World Evidence is a very effective way of meeting these requirements.</p>
              <p>At Mantra Systems, we are specialists at producing Real World Evidence generation frameworks designed specifically for PMCF under the MDR.</p>
              <h2 id="what-are-the-differences-between-real-world-evidence-and-standard-clinical-data">What are the differences between Real World Evidence and standard clinical data?</h2>
              <p>Real World Evidence is entirely different to other forms of clinical data. Real World Evidence for PMCF under the MDR should be:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>drawn from a study population that represents the entire population normally exposed to the device</li>
                <li>non-comparative, focusing only on the performance of the subject device rather than making comparisons to something else</li>
                <li>non-experimental, focusing instead on normal use of an approved device</li>
                <li>designed to run indefinitely (covering the “entire lifetime of the device”) and have no upper limit on recruitment number</li>
                <li>conducted at all types of clinical site, not just specialist units</li>
              </ul>
              <p>It should be clear that generating Real World Evidence is a specialist task that requires a carefully-designed investigation structure. A poor choice of Real World Evidence generation method may lead to a progressive accumulation of problems, as any weaknesses in the collection method or the data itself will compound over time. Choosing the wrong method can be an expensive mistake and in the worst case can lead to loss of regulatory approval for the device.</p>
              <h2 id="real-world-evidence-for-medical-devices--the-gold-standard">Real World Evidence for medical devices — the gold standard</h2>
              <p>For medical devices, the gold standard for producing Real World Evidence for PMCF is a medical device product registry. A well-designed registry enables the ongoing generation of Real World Evidence throughout the entire lifetime of a device from within a single clinical investigation framework, saving time and money and securing the regulatory status of the device.</p>
              <p>A medical device registry, if properly designed, offers a number of advantages over other methods of generating Real World Evidence. Advantages include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Enabling a consistent approach to data collection at all clinical sites, reducing variability</li>
                <li>Minimising opportunities for bias</li>
                <li>Complying with all applicable legislation (eg GDPR)</li>
                <li>Ensuring that the study is compliant with the ABHI Code and other relevant codes of practice</li>
                <li>Enabling clinical sites to be remunerated for participation in a way that is transparent, at fair market value, and compliant</li>
                <li>Having established procedures for dealing with predictable problems such as patients being lost to follow-up or clinical sites acting unreasonably or unconscionably</li>
              </ul>
              <p>A good registry also employs data entry methods that are sufficiently user-friendly to allow clinicians in practice to enter data as a component of their standard practice. This enhances data collection compliance and improves the quality of the study.</p>
              <p>Mantra Systems is a specialist at producing medical device product registries for MDR PMCF.</p>
              <h2 id="what-documentation-is-required-for-real-world-evidence-in-the-mdr">What documentation is required for Real World Evidence in the MDR?</h2>
              <p>Real World Evidence generation systems, as a component of PMCF, will need to be documented in accordance with requirements for technical documentation as specified in the MDR. Annex II and III specify a range of documents that must be produced in support of every medical device, including a PMCF Plan, PMCF Report and a Clinical Evaluation Report.</p>
              <p>Additionally, MDR Annex XV lists a range of requirements that must be adhered to for every form of clinical investigation, including those intended to generate RWE. These requirements include the need to produce a clinical investigation plan, investigator’s brochure, and informed consent form, as well as securing ethical approval where required and adhering to data protection laws and regulations.</p>
              <p>Overall, constructing a robust system for generating Real World Evidence (RWE) is a specialist task but one that will safeguard the regulatory approval status throughout its commercial lifetime.
