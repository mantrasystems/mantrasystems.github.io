Learn how to implement corrective and preventive actions (CAPAs) and best practices to enhance product quality and ensure regulatory adherence.</p>
      <p>In the highly regulated world of regulatory affairs, technical documentation serves as a cornerstone for ensuring product compliance, safety, and efficacy. Yet even the most meticulously prepared documents can face non-conformities during reviews.</p>
      <p>Let’s explore how to manage non-conformities effectively and implement corrective and preventive actions (CAPAs) to enhance the quality of technical documentation.</p>
      <h2 id="understanding-non-conformities">Understanding Non-Conformities</h2>
      <p>In the context of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/745/oj/eng">EU Medical Device Regulation</a> (EU MDR), a non-conformance refers to a situation where a medical device, process, or quality management system does not meet the requirements outlined in the regulation (<a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/quality-management-system-qms">ISO 13485</a>) and the organisation’s aligned procedures. Non-conformities can occur during numerous stages of the medical device lifecycle, including design, manufacturing, post-market surveillance, or quality management, and may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Incomplete or inaccurate content:</strong> Missing critical details like device classifications or clinical data summaries.</li>
        <li><strong>Inconsistent formatting:</strong> Deviations from templates or submission requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Outdated references:</strong> Use of superseded regulations or standards.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="the-pip-scandal-a-wake-up-call-for-managing-non-conformities">The PIP Scandal: A Wake-Up Call for Managing Non-Conformities</h2>
      <p>Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) was a French company which manufactured breast implants, and was once the world’s third biggest supplier. <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20180929-french-pip-breast-implants-scandal">The issue arose in 2010</a>, when PIP implants were revealed to be made from cheaper, industrial-grade silicone (that was not approved for medical use), and were rupturing. The silicone gel was known to cause inflammation and possible scarring, and these implants raised concerns over harmful long-term effects. This posed significant risks to patient health, leading to thousands of women receiving defective implants. The scandal highlighted severe flaws in both the manufacturing process and the regulatory oversight of medical devices.</p>
      <p>For example, the PIP implants were not subjected to adequate safety testing, and documentation of these test results was either incomplete or absent. The absence of proper validation and testing records left significant gaps in the product’s safety profile. If there had been a comprehensive review of testing protocols and documented evidence of failures or deviations from safety standards, corrective actions could have been taken much earlier.</p>
      <p>The PIP scandal serves as a stark reminder of the importance of proper documentation, regulatory compliance, and risk management in the medical device industry. When non-conformities are not adequately identified, documented, or addressed, it can lead to catastrophic results for both patients and manufacturers. The technical documentation for a medical device, such as breast implants, includes crucial elements such as design specifications, materials used, testing procedures, and safety protocols.</p>
      <h2 id="a-structured-approach-to-corrective-and-preventive-actions">A Structured Approach to Corrective and Preventive Actions</h2>
      <p>When a non-conformance is identified, it is essential to implement appropriate Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPAs). These actions must address the root cause, prevent recurrence, and ensure <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/">compliance with EU MDR</a> requirements. Prompt and effective resolution of non-conformances is crucial to maintaining product quality, ensuring patient safety, and achieving regulatory compliance in the EU market.</p>
      <p>A CAPA is a systematic approach that organisations use to identify, investigate, and address issues or non-conformities within their processes, products or services. The goal of CAPA is to both correct problems and implement measures to prevent them from happening again in the future. CAPA is made up of two components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Corrective Action (CA):</strong> Corrective Action addresses existing problems, non-conformities or deviations identified. It involves immediate or short-term actions to rectify the issue, mitigate any negative impacts, and prevent recurrence.</li>
        <li><strong>Preventive Action (PA):</strong> Preventive Action aims to identify and eliminate potential causes of problems or non-conformities before they occur. It is a proactive approach to prevent similar issues from arising in the future.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The CAPA process typically involves the following steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Identification and Reporting:</strong> Identifying the problem, non-conformity, or deviation, and reporting it.</li>
        <li><strong>Investigation and Analysis:</strong> Conducting a thorough investigation to determine the root cause of the issue.</li>
        <li><strong>Action Plan Development:</strong> Developing a corrective action plan to address the immediate issue. Then a preventive action plan to mitigate future occurrences.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Implementing the corrective actions and preventive actions according to the action plans.</li>
        <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Verifying that the actions taken have effectively addressed the issues and prevented recurrence.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring and Review:</strong> Monitoring the implemented changes to ensure they are sustained. Reviewing the effectiveness of the corrective and preventive actions over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="completing-a-root-cause-analysis">Completing a Root Cause Analysis</h2>
      <p>Root cause analysis goes beyond surface symptoms to uncover the underlying reason for the non-conformance.</p>
      <p>There are several techniques that can be used for root cause analysis, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>5 Whys:</strong> Ask “why” repeatedly. Look into the successive layers of cause and effect until reaching the fundamental reason.</li>
        <li><strong>Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa or Cause and Effect Diagram):</strong> Identify potential causes categorised into different factors.</li>
        <li><strong>Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA):</strong>  Evaluate potential failure modes and their causes, effects, and severity. Prioritise corrective and preventive actions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="best-practices-for-managing-non-conformities">Best Practices for Managing Non-Conformities</h2>
      <p>Implementing the following best practices can help organisations address issues proactively and prevent recurrence, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Conduct Regular Audits:</strong> Routinely review technical documentation to detect and resolve discrepancies before they escalate.</li>
        <li><strong>Foster Cross-Functional Collaboration:</strong> Encourage seamless cooperation between regulatory, quality assurance, and R&amp;D teams to enhance compliance and efficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Strengthen Regulatory Knowledge:</strong> Equip teams with a deep understanding of regulatory requirements and quality standards to minimise errors and improve compliance.</li>
        <li><strong>Leverage Corrective Action Requests (CARs) for Improvement:</strong> View CARs as opportunities to refine processes. Analysing non-conformance trends can reveal systemic issues that require long-term solutions.</li>
      </ul>

However, navigating its complex and ever-changing framework can feel like a maze.</p>
    <p>If you’re uncertain about the readiness of your EU MDR documentation, this article provides an overview of the essential steps to ensure you’re on track, from understanding key regulations to identifying potential gaps in your compliance process.</p>
    <h2 id="grasping-the-essentials-key-eu-mdr-requirements-you-need-to-know">Grasping the Essentials: Key EU MDR Requirements You Need to Know</h2>
    <p>Compliance is accomplished by demonstrating conformity of your device with all relevant aspects of the EU MDR. Manufacturers are required demonstrate this compliance to gain regulatory approval for their medical devices.</p>
    <p>Medical devices must be designed, manufactured, distributed, and tracked according to EU MDR requirements, and manufacturers must develop a suite of compliant regulatory systems, processes, and documents to continually monitor the safety and performance of their products.</p>
    <p>This process <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance">begins with a detailed understanding of the regulation and the obligations it imposes upon manufacturers</a>. A key part of demonstrating compliance is ensuring that your technical file includes everything required under the regulation. This consists of clinical evaluations, risk management documentation, and information on manufacturing processes. Being thorough at this stage ensures you don’t run into roadblocks later.</p>
    <h2 id="conquering-your-technical-documentation-a-thorough-review-is-essential">Conquering Your Technical Documentation: A Thorough Review is Essential</h2>
    <p>One of the most essential aspects of EU MDR compliance is your technical documentation. The regulation requires manufacturers to maintain detailed files that provide evidence of the safety, performance, and risk management of their products. These files must be available for review by Notified Bodies during audits and inspections.</p>
    <p>Regulatory systems, processes, and documents required for compliance are more extensive than those necessary under the outgoing Medical Device Directive (MDD). Those required for MDR Compliance include the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Quality Management System (<a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/quality-management-system-qms">QMS</a>)</strong> covering the activities of the entire organisation</li>
      <li><strong>Post-Market Surveillance (<a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/post-market-surveillance-pms">PMS</a>)</strong> system monitoring safety and performance of each device following release onto the market</li>
      <li><strong>Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (<a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/post-market-clinical-follow-up-pmcf">PMCF</a>)</strong> and <strong>Vigilance system</strong> for each device</li>
      <li><strong>Risk Management system</strong> to the standard in <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/72704.html">ISO 14971:2019</a> or equivalent</li>
      <li><strong>Clinical Evaluation</strong> process for every medical device, documented as a State-of-the-Art Report (SOTA), Clinical Evaluation Report (CEP), and a Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) which must be continuously updated at appropriate intervals</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Carefully reviewing each section of your technical file is essential. Missing even a small piece of documentation can cause delays or, worse, non-compliance. Successful compliance is demonstrated by the application of a CE-mark to the device.</p>
    <p>Class I manufacturers (except for devices that are sterile or have a measuring function) may self-apply a CE-mark after producing a declaration of conformity. For all other classes of medical devices, a CE-mark may only be affixed once a Notified Body has issued a certificate of conformity following a regulatory review according to rules in Chapter IV of the MDR.</p>
    <h2 id="navigating-special-cases-ensuring-conformity-with-eu-mdr-requirements">Navigating Special Cases: Ensuring Conformity with EU MDR Requirements</h2>
    <p>Certain devices, particularly those that include medicinal substances or components of animal or human origin, have additional requirements under the EU MDR. These special cases require detailed documentation to ensure compliance with stricter regulations. It’s important to identify if your device falls under these categories and ensure that you are meeting the additional regulatory requirements.</p>
    <p>This can often be a challenging aspect of compliance. For example, if your device uses a medicinal substance or has biological components, it may be subject to additional testing and reporting obligations, e.g., a medicinal dossier. Understanding these specifics early on in the process can save you time and prevent future compliance hurdles.</p>
    <h2 id="stay-compliant-the-importance-of-regularly-updating-your-documentation">Stay Compliant: The Importance of Regularly Updating Your Documentation</h2>
    <p>EU MDR compliance is an ongoing process. It’s not enough to simply submit your documentation and wait for approval. Once your device is on the market, continuous monitoring through PMS and PMCF is required. You must regularly update your technical file to reflect any changes, including modifications to the device, new clinical data, or updates to regulatory requirements.</p>
    <p>Additionally, your clinical evaluations should be regularly reviewed to ensure that new evidence supports the ongoing safety and performance of your device.</p>

A recent EU survey has paved the way for significant expansion, enabling more devices to move away from traditional paper IFUs. This article breaks down the key changes and what they mean for you.</p>
  <p>The EU MDR establishes the general requirements for instructions for use (IFU). <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2021/2226/oj/eng">Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/2226</a> determines which devices can use Electronic Instructions for Use (eIFUs), and which must use physical IFUs. In this article, we will review its key information and how it affects the medical device industry and examine a new draft amendment to the legislation.</p>
  <p>The legislation defines instructions for use in electronic form as “<em>instructions for use displayed in electronic form by the device, contained in portable storage media supplied by the manufacturer together with the device, or made available through a software or a website.</em>” Essentially, eIFUs are digital instructions, accessible via the device, storage media, software, or a website.</p>
  <p>For a more detailed look at what needs to go in your IFU, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eu-mdr-requirements-writing-ifu-what-you-need-know-mantrasystems-1wpee/">check out our recent article</a> on the topic.</p>
  <h2 id="which-devices-can-currently-have-an-eifu">Which devices can currently have an eIFU?</h2>
  <p>While all manufacturers must provide an electronic copy of the IFU on their website, they may currently only be provided instead of paper for the following categories of devices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implantable and active implantable devices and their accessories (e.g. pacemakers)</li>
    <li>Fixed medical devices and their accessories (e.g. MRI scanner)</li>
    <li>Medical devices and their accessories fitted with a built-in system for visually displaying the instructions for use (e.g. ultrasound equipment)</li>
    <li>If a device fits into one of these groups, it must also be intended for use only by professional users and have undergone a comprehensive risk analysis as discussed below.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="eifu-and-software-as-a-medical-device-samd">eIFU and Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)</h3>
  <p>For SaMD covered by the MDR, eIFUs are permitted for devices intended for use by all user types, including lay persons. Manufacturers may provide eIFUs using the software itself instead of in paper form.</p>
  <h2 id="why-was-the-amendment-introduced">Why was the amendment introduced?</h2>
  <p>The Commission carried out a survey on replacing paper-based IFUs with eIFUs from 1st August to 10th October 2024. The survey results showed a clear preference among healthcare professionals for receiving IFUs electronically rather than on paper. They concluded that providing IFUs in electronic form helps the health sector deliver better and faster solutions.</p>
  <p>The amendment proposes broadening the scope of application of IR (EU) 2021/2226 to “all medical devices and their accessories covered by the EU MDR <strong><em>that are intended for professional users</em></strong>”.</p>
  <p>More significantly, the Commission are currently collecting feedback from stakeholders on the proposed amendment, so <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14470-Medical-devices-electronic-instructions-for-use_en">complete their survey</a> to have your say and make sure your voice is heard.</p>
  <h2 id="risk-assessment-and-eifus">Risk assessment and eIFUs</h2>
  <p>Devices utilising eIFUs must undergo the same comprehensive risk assessment as all devices under the EU MDR. IR 2021/22226 supplements this with additional areas which the risk assessment must cover:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>That the user has access, knowledge and experience of the hardware and software needed to display the instructions for use in electronic form.</li>
    <li>Safeguards are needed to ensure that the electronic data and content are protected from tampering, and that backup mechanisms are in place in case of a hardware or software fault.</li>
    <li>Foreseeable medical emergencies requiring the provision of information in paper form, and an evaluation of the period within which a paper IFU shall be provided upon request.</li>
    <li>The impact caused by the temporary unavailability of the specific website or the internet in general.</li>
    <li>Assessment of the website’s compatibility and usability, and its ability to display eIFUs of multiple different devices while minimising the risk of users looking at the wrong eIFU.</li>
    <li>The management of different versions of the eIFU.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Manufacturers can only proceed with an eIFU if this risk assessment demonstrates no decreased level of safety compared to a paper IFU.</p>
  <h2 id="further-requirements-for-manufacturers">Further requirements for manufacturers</h2>
  <p>If manufacturers provide only an eIFU, they must follow these obligations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They must have a system in place to provide a paper IFU at no additional cost to the user at the latest within 7 days of receiving a request from a user.</li>
    <li>The existence of an eIFU must be indicated on the label.</li>
    <li>eIFUs must be available on their website in any official language of the EU, as per the member state in which the device is used.</li>
    <li>All historical eIFUs shall be available on their website.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The new draft amendment to the regulation also stipulates that eIFUs must be available through a persistently accessible URL, which the manufacturer shall provide to the UDI database.</p>
  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>eIFUs offer many benefits to both manufacturers and users. They are often easier to access, reduce physical IFU production costs, and can be updated far more quickly than paper IFUs. They are, however, limited by poor internet access and user interface design challenges.</p>
  <p>The future of IFUs is digital, delivering cost savings, faster updates, and improved accessibility. Navigating the regulatory landscape can be challenging, but with Mantra Systems, you can move forward with confidence. <a href="/contact">Act now — partner with us</a> to ensure your eIFUs are compliant and your devices are approved without delay.</p>

This article unpacks the key requirements and provides actionable strategies for compliance.</p>
  <p><a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/risk-management">Risk management</a> is a significant component of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/745/oj/eng">EU MDR 2017/745</a> and is vital to ensure the safety of patients and medical device users. A thorough approach to risk management activities is essential for medical device manufacturers to demonstrate conformity with the requirements of the EU MDR. In this article, we will explore the requirements placed on medical device manufacturers by the EU MDR and provide an overview on how to address them.</p>
  <h2 id="what-are-the-requirements">What are the requirements?</h2>
  <p>Article 10, point 2 of the EU MDR stipulates that manufacturers are required to establish, document, implement and maintain a system for risk management. It can therefore be clearly interpreted that risk management must be an ongoing process throughout the lifecycle of a device, rather than a ‘one-off’ exercise. A continuous approach to risk management is pivotal in ensuring compliance with regulatory complaints and, moreover, safeguarding patients and device users from avoidable harm.</p>
  <p>A more detailed breakdown of risk management requirements can be found in Annex I, points 2-8 of the EU MDR. In summary, the points stipulate that manufacturers must:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce risks as far as possible without negatively affecting the benefit/risk profile of a device.</li>
    <li>Establish, document, implement and maintain a risk management system throughout the entire lifecycle of a device. This process includes:
      <ul>
        <li>Development of a risk management plan</li>
        <li>Identification of known and foreseeable hazards associated with the device</li>
        <li>Evaluation of risks associated with the device during intended and reasonably foreseeable misuse</li>
        <li>Implementation of measures to control or eliminate identified risks</li>
        <li>Incorporation of information gathered during device production and <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/post-market-surveillance-pms">post-market surveillance (PMS)</a> regarding the frequency of identified risks</li>
        <li>Implementation/amendment of risk control measures to address new risks, or risks with greater frequency than initially forecast, based on information obtained through PMS activities.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Manage risks to an extent that the residual risk associated with each hazard, and the overall residual risk of a device, is acceptable.</li>
    <li>Inform users of any residual risks</li>
    <li>Reduce or eliminate risks relating to user error</li>
    <li>Ensure that the safety of patients and device users is not affected by the impact of stresses and environmental factors on device performance under normal conditions of use throughout the lifetime of the device.</li>
    <li>Design, manufacture and package devices in a manner that ensures their characteristics and performance are not affected during storage and transport.</li>
    <li>Ensure that all foreseeable risks and undesirable side effects are reduced as far as possible and deemed acceptable when weighed against the benefit of a device to patients and users.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Annex I, point 9 refers to the requirement for devices without an intended medical purpose, as outlined in Annex XVI, to present no risk at all or a risk that is no greater than the maximum acceptable risk related to the device’s use. Interpretation of this statement would infer that, for devices without an intended medical purpose that remain governed by MDR, the level of acceptable risk is minimal. Devices falling under this bracket include:</p>

  <h2 id="how-do-we-meet-the-requirements">How do we meet the requirements?</h2>
  <p>One approach to meeting the requirements for risk management is to align risk management procedures with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/quick-guide-iso-14971-risk-management-mantrasystems-xwtne/">BS EN ISO 14971</a>, since the standard is aligned with the General Safety and Performance Requirements of the EU MDR.</p>
  <p>BS EN ISO 14971 describes 6 distinct steps in the overall risk management process, as demonstrated below:</p>

  </figure>
  <h2 id="risk-management-plan">Risk Management Plan</h2>
  <p>It is essential that all activities conducted during risk management are planned and that this plan is documented. A robust risk management plan will describe the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Assignment of responsibilities and authorities for risk management processes.</li>
    <li>A roadmap for risk management activities to be conducted, based on the 6 defined process steps in BS EN ISO 14971.</li>
    <li>A procedure for the identification and analysis of risks associated with the device throughout its lifetime.</li>
    <li>Criteria for determination of risk acceptability.</li>
    <li>A procedure for the identification and implementation of appropriate risk control measures.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A procedure for the evaluation of individual and overall residual risks following the implementation of risk control measures.</p>
  <p>A process for the collection and review of production and post-production information.</p>
  <h2 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h2>
  <p>Risk assessment involves the analysis of risks by identifying all relevant hazards, hazardous situations and harms, and estimating the probability and severity of identified risks. In order to provide a framework for the identification of risks, it is beneficial to consider the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Definition of intended use:
      <ul>
        <li>Intended medical indication and target medical condition</li>
        <li>Target patient population
          <ul>
            <li>Demographics</li>
            <li>Disease state and stage</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Part of body/type of tissue the device interacts with</li>
        <li>Device user profile
          <ul>
            <li>Age</li>
            <li>Medical professionals and/or laypersons</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Use environment</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Definition of reasonably foreseeable misuse:
      <ul>
        <li>Accidental use error</li>
        <li>Use under the wrong conditions</li>
        <li>Impact of intentional misuse</li>
        <li>Use for non-intended clinical indications</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Characteristics related to safety</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A comprehensive list of hazards, hazardous situations and associated harms can be identified following the definition of intended use, reasonably foreseeable misuse and characteristics related to safety. According to the definitions in BS EN ISO 14971, a hazard cannot result in harm until a sequence of events or circumstances (including normal use and reasonably foreseeable misuse) leads to a hazardous situation. Each hazard (e.g. device size too small) can be associated with several hazardous situations (e.g. pressure of device against skin), each associated with several potential harms (e.g. skin abrasion). Once a risk has been followed through from hazard to harm, it can be assessed by estimating both severity and probability of occurrence of harm that could result. A pre-determined criteria of risk acceptability, as documented in the risk management plan, can then be applied based on the estimated risk probability and severity.</p>
  <h2 id="risk-control">Risk control</h2>
  <p>The application of appropriate risk control measures to reduce the probability and/or severity of each identified potential harm, regardless of initial evaluation of acceptability, is required. This process ensures that each identified risk has been reduced as far as possible, without negatively affecting the overall benefit-risk profile of the device.</p>
  <p><a href="/enable-ce-mark/online-video-training-courses/risk-management">BS EN ISO 14971</a> sets out 3 broad risk control options for medical device manufacturers, in descending order of effectiveness, as described below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Elimination of risk through design of the device. Examples include:
      <ul>
        <li>Design without sharp edges</li>
        <li>Make dangerous electrical equipment inaccessible</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Reduction of risk through the addition of protective measures in the medical device itself or in the manufacturing process. Examples include:
      <ul>
        <li>Alarms</li>
        <li>Protective covers</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Reduction of risk through the provision of information for the safety of device users/operators. Examples include:
      <ul>
        <li>Warnings/precautions</li>
        <li>Promotion of use of protective equipment</li>
        <li>Instructions for use</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="evaluation-of-residual-risk">Evaluation of Residual Risk</h2>
  <p>Following the implementation of control measures to each identified risk, the probability and severity of each individual risk can be re-estimated, and the previously documented risk acceptability criteria re-applied to determine individual residual risks.</p>
  <p>Risk management requirements under the EU MDR place an onus on manufacturers to also assess overall residual risk, whereby the acceptability of all residual risks taken together must be determined.  As is the case when determining the acceptability of individual risks, a pre-determined criteria of acceptability must be documented and followed when evaluating overall residual risk. The assessment of overall residual risk should consider the distribution of individual residual risks by acceptability category. For example, even in the absence of any unacceptable individual risks, if a significant proportion of individual risks are considered ‘borderline’ the overall residual risk associated with a device may be deemed unacceptable. If this is the case, manufacturers must implement additional risk control measures, consider modifying the device design and manufacturing process, or place restrictions on the intended use or users, before re-evaluating individual and overall residual risks.</p>
  <p>Manufacturers are required to disclose any significant residual risks by providing relevant information in the device labelling and Instructions for Use documentation. The disclosure of residual risks should not be confused with information for safety, which forms part of the risk control process. The disclosure of residual risk does not in itself provide information which can reduce the probability or severity of a given risk, instead providing users with an overview of the risks associated with a device that remain after risk control measures have been implemented. Further guidance on the disclosure of residual risk, and information for safety, can be found in ISO/TR 24971.</p>
  <h2 id="risk-management-review">Risk Management Review</h2>
  <p>Once all the risk management activities described above have completed, manufacturers are required to conduct a risk management review. The review must assess whether all procedures in the Risk Management Plan were adhered to and a robust conclusion that the overall residual risk of the device is acceptable must be made. Finally, practices for the collection and assessment of production and post-production information relating to the risk of the device must be decided on and documented. The processes and conclusions of the risk management review must be documented in a Risk Management Report.</p>
  <h2 id="production-and-post-production-activities">Production and Post-Production Activities</h2>
  <p>BS EN ISO 14971 describes the requirement for manufacturers to implement, document and maintain a system to collect and analyse information relating to the safety of a medical device during its production and post-production phases.</p>
  <p>The collection of relevant information should encompass feedback and data from a variety of sources, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Information from the supply chain relating to production and distribution of the device.</li>
    <li>Information gathered during the production process.</li>
    <li>Information from those responsible for installation and maintenance of the device.</li>
    <li>Information from users of the device.</li>
    <li>Information relating to the device or similar devices which is publicly available.</li>
    <li>Information regarding updates to the state of the art.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When the relevant information has been collected, it must be subject to a formal review, with a focus on relevance of the information to the safety of the subject device. The review should identify the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Any hazards or hazardous situations that were not addressed during initial risk management procedures.</li>
    <li>Previously addressed hazardous situations which have become unacceptable due to the impact of collected information.</li>
    <li>If the overall residual risk remains acceptable or is now unacceptable.</li>
    <li>Updates to the acknowledged state of the art which may impact the safety profile of the device.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Following a review of information gathered during production and post-production activities, manufacturers must determine whether any action is required. This process should include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Review of the risk management file and reassessment of previously identified risks for appropriateness of the estimated severity and probability.</li>
    <li>Evaluation of new identified risks with a determination of risk acceptability, implementation of risk control measures and assessment of residual risk as previously carried out.</li>
    <li>Reassessment of overall residual risk of the device.</li>
    <li>Determination of whether actions related to already marketed devices, such as device recall, are required based on new information.</li>
    <li>Evaluation of the impact of new information on previous risk management activities.</li>
    <li>A determination of the suitability of risk management procedures by top management.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The EU MDR places significant risk management requirements on manufacturers of all medical devices. In order to demonstrate compliance, a detailed, well-documented. procedure-driven approach to all aspects of risk management must be implemented. In addition, risk management procedures must be viewed as an ongoing process throughout the lifetime of a device, rather than a one-off exercise.</p>
  <p>Though risk management compliance may seem daunting for manufacturers, embracing the requirements is an opportunity for manufacturers to support the safety of their device, and to utilise the data gathered to adopt a strong position in the market.</p>

  <p>As software advancements continue, the line between traditional hardware-centric medical devices and software-driven solutions becomes increasingly blurred. Enter the domains of Software in a Medical Device (SiMD), referring to software that is integral to the functioning of a physical medical device, and <a href="/solutions/regulatory-consulting-for-samd-software-as-a-medical-device">Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)</a>, which operates independently to perform medical functions. These two, while closely linked, serve as distinctive categories in the medical technology landscape.</p>
  <h2 id="software-as-a-medical-device-samd">Software <em>as a</em> Medical Device (SaMD)</h2>
  <p>Software as a medical device is defined by the <a href="https://www.imdrf.org/sites/default/files/docs/imdrf/final/technical/imdrf-tech-131209-samd-key-definitions-140901.pdf">International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF)</a> as:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“<em>software intended to be used for one or more medical purposes that perform these purposes without being part of a hardware medical device.</em>”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Although this definition offers guidance on what falls under the term SaMD, it’s possible there could still be confusion regarding what constitutes a SaMD product, as applications can integrate with hardware devices without being part of them.</p>
  <p>Examples Include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An app that calculates appropriate insulin dosage based on a person’s blood glucose levels.</li>
    <li>Software that draws data from other digital devices to determine risk factors associated with epileptic seizures</li>
    <li>Software that uses artificial intelligence to look at MRI images to identify anomalies missed by other diagnostic tools (like an electrocardiogram)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="software-in-a-medical-device-simd">Software <em>in a</em> Medical Device (SiMD)</h2>
  <p>According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), SiMD refers to software that is incorporated into a medical device to control its performance or provide specific functions. SiMD is also known as embedded software, firmware, or microcode. Unlike SaMD, SiMD can’t function independently, and is instead reliant on the associated medical hardware. Since the software contributes to the device’s intended purpose, any malfunction or failure could impact the safety and performance of the entire medical device.</p>
  <p>Examples Include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Software embedded in a pacemaker, or defibrillator that monitors heart rhythm, calculates responses, and delivers electrical impulses</li>
    <li>Software that powers infusion pumps, glucose meters, and smart pens</li>
    <li>A mobile application that is the primary interface for reading continuous waveform data from an implanted or wearable EKG loop monitor</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="mdr-in-focus-how-it-applies-to-samd-and-simd">MDR in Focus: How it applies to SaMD and SiMD</h2>
  <h3 id="samd">SaMD</h3>
  <p>SaMD is classified under the MDR using a risk-based approach, aligning with its potential impact on patient health and safety. Risk classification is determined based on the level of risk posed to patients, similar to traditional medical devices. SaMD must undergo a conformity assessment in accordance with its risk classification. Higher-risk SaMD oftent require Notified Body (NB) involvement for certification, whereas lower-risk software (e.g., Class I) may only require self-certification.</p>
  <p>SaMD classification follows MDR Annex VIII, Rule 11:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Class I:</strong> Low-risk software, such as apps for general health tracking.</li>
    <li><strong>Class IIa:</strong> Medium-risk software that supports decision-making for non-critical conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Class IIb:</strong> Higher-risk software, such as diagnostic tools that influence significant treatment decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Class III:</strong> High-risk software used in critical or life-threatening situations, such as applications for surgical planning or cancer treatment.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="simd">SiMD</h3>
  <p>SiMD classification differs from SaMD and is typically evaluated within the regulatory framework of the overall medical device it accompanies. As a result, its risk classification is influenced by the combined risk of both the software and the device’s hardware. Consequently, SiMD must undergo a conformity assessment of the entire device. This means that even if the software alone is low risk, it must still meet the same regulatory scrutiny as the physical device, which may require NB involvement depending on the device classification.</p>
  <p>Despite their differences, Both SaMD and SiMD require rigorous clinical evaluation, risk management, and post-market monitoring, but the MDR treats them distinctly based on how they are used in medical practice.</p>
  <h2 id="unpacking-the-divide-samd-vs-simd">Unpacking the Divide: SaMD vs. SiMD</h2>
  <p>Overall, there are a few differences in the safety and efficacy standards that apply to SaMD and SiMD. Compliance around <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/38421.html">IEC 62304</a> (which outlines requirements for the safe design and maintenance of medical device software throughout its lifecycle), <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/63179.html">IEC 62366</a> (which focuses on usability engineering to ensure medical devices are safe and effective for users), and <a href="https://www.mantrasystems.co.uk/enable-ce-mark/online-video-training-courses/risk-management">ISO 14971</a> (which provides a framework for identifying, evaluating, and mitigating risks associated with medical devices) are the same.</p>
  <p>For example, both SaMD and SiMD must be classified according to IEC 62304 as far as class A, B, and C software where A is low-risk software and C is high-risk software. However, SiMD also has to meet additional requirements that concern hardware, and hardware and software integration. Compliance with these regulations ensures the safety and performance of the integrated software as part of the overall medical device.</p>
  <h2 id="navigating-the-nuances-final-takeaways-on-samd-vs-simd">Navigating the Nuances: Final Takeaways on SaMD vs. SiMD</h2>
  <p>The rise of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mantrasystems_regulatory-consulting-for-software-as-a-medical-activity-7295456626759614464-z-AN">SaMD</a> and SiMD highlights a significant shift in healthcare toward more personalised, accessible, and data-driven care. It reflects the remarkable progress in integrating technology with health while underscoring the critical responsibility to ensure these innovations prioritise patient safety.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, as we continue to explore the evolving landscape of SaMD and SiMD, understanding their complexities and distinctions is more important than ever. As the boundaries between software and medical devices become increasingly intertwined, our focus must remain steadfast on developing safe, effective, and forward-thinking solutions that enhance patient outcomes.</p>

In this article, Kamiya Crabtree explains what this means for you.</p>
  <p>Recently, <a href="https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/dfd7a1c6-f319-4682-9bac-77bef1165818_en">the EU has extended the validity of EU IVDD</a> (In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive) certificates and declarations. The EU has updated the timelines for IVD devices to align with the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Regulation (2017/746) (EU IVDR). As a result, devices with EU IVDD certificates will now be allowed to remain on the EU market for a longer period of time.</p>
  <p>Previously, IVDD CE certificates and declarations of conformity were set to expire on 26th May 2025. Under the updated transitional provisions, the validity of certain certificates and declarations has been extended as follows:</p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Device classification</th>
        <th>New deadline</th>
        <th>Applies as long as…</th>

        <th>Annex II List A devices</th>
        <td rowspan="4">31st December 2027</td>
        <td rowspan="3">The CE certificate was issued after 25th May 2017 and was still valid on 26th May 2022.</td>

      <tr>
        <th>Class A devices placed on the market in a sterile condition</th>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>Key points to note:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Notified Bodies are not required to change the date on the individual certificates</li>
    <li>The above dates are subject to meeting the relevant conditions under EU IVDR Article 110(3c)</li>
    <li>If your device is being placed on both the GB and NI markets, you should upload a single declaration confirming that the Article 110 extended CE certificate validity applies to both markets.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Unsure which IVDR classification applies to your product? <a href="/articles/understanding-risk-based-classification-of-in-vitro-medical-devices-under-eu-ivdr">Find out more about what the new classification system means for you</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="extended-validity-in-the-uk">Extended validity in the UK</h2>
  <p>The MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/registration-of-in-vitro-diagnostic-devices-with-expiring-ce-certificates/registration-of-certain-in-vitro-diagnostic-devices">has issued new guidance on the impact of these new deadlines on the UK</a>.</p>
  <h3 id="great-britain-gb--england-wales-and-scotland">Great Britain (GB) – England, Wales, and Scotland</h3>
  <p>To support the safe supply of medical devices to GB and make the transition to the new regulatory framework smoother, the government has put in place legislation that extends the acceptance of CE-marked IVD devices. This means that CE-marked IVD devices, whether compliant with the EU IVDD or the EU IVDR, can continue to be placed on the GB market until the 30th June 2030 (or until the certificate expires).</p>
  <p>This is great news because it allows certain devices to stay on the market longer. However, there’s a key limitation: general IVD devices that were previously not required to involve a Notified Body under the EU IVDD will only be allowed on the GB market if they are upclassified (meaning the involvement of a Notified Body is now required under the EU IVDR).</p>
  <p>It’s also important to note that manufacturers won’t be able to use expired certificates, unless the EU has deemed them valid under specific conditions.</p>
  <p>So, if you’re relying on an EU IVDD CE certificate with extended validity under Article 110 to place devices on the GB market, be sure to <a href="https://aic.mhra.gov.uk/era/drsystem.nsf/a508926735cb834f802576880054e0c3/0afbc51d01dee249802577f0003861bb">update the MHRA Device Online Registration System</a> as outlined in the guidance. The devices can stay on the market until the 30th June 2030 (or until the certificate expires).</p>
  <h3 id="northern-ireland-ni">Northern Ireland (NI)</h3>
  <p>The rules for placing IVD devices on the NI market are different from those for GB. Since 26th May 2022, the EU IVDR has applied in both EU Member States and Northern Ireland.</p>
  <p>CE certificates with extended validity under the EU IVDR transitional arrangements (Article 110) can still be used to place devices on the NI market, as long as EU IVDD CE-marked medical devices are accepted.</p>
  <p>For these devices to be valid on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/medical-devices-eu-regulations-for-mdr-and-ivdr">NI market</a>, they must meet the conditions set out in Article 110(3c), including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Continued compliance with Directive 98/79/EC</li>
    <li>No significant changes to the design or intended purpose</li>
    <li>No unacceptable risk to the health or safety of patients, users, or others, or to public health protection</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Additionally, there are some important steps you must follow:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>By 26th May 2025, you’ll need to provide evidence that you’ve implemented a quality management system in accordance with EU IVDR Article 10(8).</li>
    <li>By 26th May 2025, you’ll also need to provide evidence that you or your authorised representative have made a formal application to a Notified Body.</li>
    <li>By 26th September 2025, you must provide evidence that both the Notified Body and the manufacturer have signed a written agreement.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you plan to rely on an EU IVDD CE certificate with extended validity under Article 110 for placing devices on the NI market, the MHRA encourages you to reflect this on the <a href="https://aic.mhra.gov.uk/era/drsystem.nsf/a508926735cb834f802576880054e0c3/0afbc51d01dee249802577f0003861bb">MHRA Device Online Registration System</a>.</p>
  <h3 id="previously-expired-certificates">Previously expired certificates</h3>
  <p>If you want to rely on a certificate that expired before 9th July 2024 but was still valid on 26th May 2022, you must upload a letter from the Notified Body. This letter should confirm that they’ve received the manufacturer’s application for conformity assessment and that a written agreement has been finalised.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, you could upload a completed template instead of the letter, which should declare that the key conditions for extending the certificate under EU IVDR Article 110 have been met. These conditions include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A signed contract with the Notified Body that was in place before the certificate expired, or</li>
    <li>If no contract existed at the time of expiry, confirmation that the manufacturer had received a derogation from conformity assessment procedures under Article 54(1) of the EU IVDR, or</li>
    <li>Confirmation that they were allowed extra time to complete the conformity assessment as per Article 92(1) of the EU IVDR.</li>
  </ul>

The General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs) are a key aspect of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017R0745">Medical Device Regulation (MDR)</a> and <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017R0746"><em>In Vitro</em> Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (IVDR)</a>, ensuring that medical devices in the European Union (EU) meet high standards of safety and performance. In our new GSPR series, we will take an in-depth look at each of the GSPRs, outlining the key requirements to ensure compliance.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mantrasystems_medicaldevices-gspr-mdr-activity-7262434101956165632-TaAy">GSPRs</a> specify the essential requirements that medical devices must meet to be placed on the market, and they cover a wide range of topics including design and manufacturing, risk management, labelling, and instructions for use. Compliance with the GSPRs is mandatory, and failure to meet these requirements can result in serious consequences, such as product recalls, fines, or legal action.</p>
  <p>In the first article of the GSPR series, we will be taking a look at GSPR 1:</p>
  <!-- TODO: Markup properly -->
  <blockquote>
    <p>“<em>Devices shall achieve the performance intended by their manufacturer and shall be designed and manufactured in such a way that, during normal conditions of use, they are suitable for their intended purpose. They shall be safe and effective and shall not compromise the clinical condition or the safety of patients, or the safety and health of users or, where applicable, other persons, provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety, taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art.</em>”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2 id="understanding-gspr1-the-basics">Understanding GSPR1: The Basics</h2>
  <p>GSPR 1 is one of the foundational requirements under the <a href="/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/ivdr-consulting">IVDR</a>/<a href="/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/mdr-consulting">MDR</a>, to regulate the safety and efficacy of medical devices in the EU. It outlines a comprehensive approach to ensuring that medical devices are safe, effective, and of high quality. This specific requirement focuses on ensuring that the design and manufacturing of these devices must prioritise safety in a way that minimises risk to both patients and users.</p>
  <p>The regulation mandates that manufacturers must design their devices with a comprehensive risk management process in place. This includes identifying potential risks and mitigating them through:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Design:</strong> The design phase involves developing the device in such a way that risks to patient safety and device performance are minimised. This could mean ensuring the device operates effectively under all intended conditions, incorporating fail-safes, or using ergonomic designs that reduce the likelihood of user error.</li>
    <li><strong>Material selection:</strong> Choosing the right materials is crucial to ensure that the device is safe for its intended use. This includes considering factors such as biocompatibility, durability, and potential for allergic reactions or other adverse events.</li>
    <li><strong>Testing before the device can be marketed or used on patients:</strong> Extensive testing is required before the device can be marketed. This involves testing to confirm that the device meets the required safety and performance standards. Testing helps to identify any potential issues that may not have been apparent during the design or material selection phases.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These safeguards are proposed to prevent harm in the short and long term.</p>
  <h2 id="gspr1-core-principles-you-need-to-know">GSPR1: Core Principles You Need to Know</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="/enable-ce-mark/online-video-training-courses/risk-management">Risk Management</a></strong> – A robust risk management system lies at the heart of GSPR 1. All possible hazards associated with the device, including any foreseeable misuse, need to be assessed by the manufacturer. These risk assessments must be done throughout the product’s lifetime, from design and development to production and use. One of the key aims is to ensure there is a minimal likelihood of harm, and if risks are identified, they are appropriately mitigated.</li>
    <li><strong>Quality</strong> – GSPR 1 stresses that the design and manufacturing process should ensure that the device maintains its performance for the duration of its use. The conditions that it is subjected to during its intended use should be withstood by the device, and manufacturers are to ensure its durability.</li>
    <li><strong>Biocompatibility</strong> – GSPR 1 mandates that the materials used in medical devices must be compatible with the human body, not causing any adverse reactions. Manufacturers must ensure that the material does not provoke harmful immune responses, toxicity, or irritation, regardless of whether the device will have direct or indirect contact with the patient. Biocompatibility testing is essential to verify that the materials used will not negatively affect patients. This is especially important for implantable devices or those that are used over extended periods.</li>
    <li><strong>Design Considerations</strong> – The design of the device plays a pivotal role in preventing user error. GSPR 1 requires that devices are designed in a way that reduces the risk of incorrect use – whether that be considerations like intuitive user interfaces, clear instructions, or an ergonomic design.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="why-gspr1-matters-key-reasons-for-compliance">Why GSPR1 Matters: Key Reasons for Compliance</h2>
  <p>GSPR 1 serves as a cornerstone of patient and user safety. By ensuring that safety and performance are prioritised from the earliest stages of design and manufacturing, this regulation aims to prevent potential harm before it happens.</p>
  <p>The requirement also fosters innovation in device design by encouraging manufacturers to continuously evaluate and enhance safety features. With an emphasis on risk management and continual improvement, GSPR 1 not only meets current needs but anticipates future challenges, allowing the medical device industry to respond effectively to evolving healthcare environments and patient needs.</p>
  <h2 id="the-bottom-line-gspr-1s-impact-on-the-future">The Bottom Line: GSPR 1’s Impact on the Future</h2>
  <p>GSPR 1 is fundamental within the MDR and IVDR and underscores the importance of designing and manufacturing devices that prioritise the safety and performance of both patients and users of the medical device. Through rigorous risk management, thought-out material selection, and user-centred design, GSPR 1 seeks to ensure that medical devices do not pose harm to those relying on them for care.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, GSPR 1 represents a commitment by the medical device industry to uphold the highest standards of safety and quality, fostering trust in devices that are critical to patient health and wellbeing.</p>

  <p>These vulnerabilities, which include a software backdoor, could compromise digital security and pose significant risks to patients when the devices are connected to the internet. As more medical devices become internet-connected, this development underscores the critical importance of robust cybersecurity measures in protecting patient safety and data.</p>
  <p>While the FDA’s warning highlights the risks, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/745/oj/eng">EU Medical Device Regulations (MDR)</a> and <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/746/oj/eng">In-Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (IVDR)</a> introduced stricter safety requirements to address such challenges. These regulations apply to medical devices that incorporate electronic programmable systems and software, which are now classified as medical devices themselves. Manufacturers must design and manufacture devices in accordance with the state of the art by applying risk management principles, including information security. Additionally, the regulations establish minimum IT security requirements, including protection against unauthorised access.</p>
  <p>In this article we discuss cybersecurity requirements of the EU MDR and IVDR and summarise the Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) guidance document - <a href="https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/download/b23b362f-8a56-434c-922a-5b3ca4d0a7a1_en">MDCG 2019-16 Rev 1</a>: Guidance on Cybersecurity for medical devices.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-cybersecurity">What is cybersecurity?</h2>
  <p>In ISO 81001-1, cybersecurity is defined as:</p>
  <!-- TODO:Markup properly -->
  <blockquote>
    <p>“<em>a state where information and systems are protected from unauthorised activities, such as access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction to a degree that the related risks to confidentiality, integrity, and availability are maintained at an acceptable level throughout the life cycle</em>”.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2 id="what-guidance-does-the-mdcg-2019-16-rev-1-provide">What guidance does the MDCG 2019-16 Rev 1 provide?</h2>
  <p>The MDCG 2019-16 Rev 1 provides guidance on fulfilling the general safety and performance requirements of Annex I of the EU MDR and IVDR concerning cybersecurity. It emphasises a “secure by design” approach, integrating cybersecurity into every stage of a medical device’s lifecycle. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Security Risk Management:</strong> Manufacturers must establish a process to identify, evaluate, and mitigate cybersecurity risks, aligning with the overall risk management system required by the MDR.</li>
    <li><strong>Security Capabilities:</strong> Devices should incorporate essential security features such as authentication, encryption, and malware protection, tailored to their intended use and operational environment.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum IT Requirements:</strong> Manufacturers must define and communicate the minimum IT security requirements for the device’s operating environment, including hardware and network characteristics, to ensure baseline protection.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The guidance also addresses the complex medical device supply chain, providing supplementary considerations for actors other than manufacturers. Additionally, it includes an annex outlining other EU and global legislation and guidance relevant to cybersecurity.</p>
  <h2 id="what-are-the-cybersecurity-requirements-contained-in-mdr-annex-i">What are the cybersecurity requirements contained in MDR Annex I?</h2>
  <h3 id="basic-cybersecurity-requirements">Basic Cybersecurity Requirements</h3>
  <p>Annex I of the MDR and IVDR emphasise the importance of cybersecurity in maintaining the general safety and performance requirements of medical devices with a focus on cybersecurity. The requirements are categorised into three key areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>IT Security:</strong> Protecting the information technology systems of medical devices is crucial. This includes safeguarding against unauthorised access and ensuring data integrity (referencing sections 17.4, 23.4ab).</li>
    <li><strong>Operation Security:</strong> Devices must operate securely under all conditions. This involves ensuring that the device functions as intended without compromising safety (referencing sections 14.1, 14.2, 17.1).</li>
    <li><strong>Information Security:</strong> Protecting sensitive data is a top priority. Medical devices must ensure that patient data and other critical information are secure from breaches (referencing section 17.2).</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="requirements-for-the-secure-design-and-manufacture-of-medical-devices">Requirements for the Secure Design and Manufacture of Medical Devices</h3>
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/content/articles/inline/understanding-cybersecurity-requirements-for-medical-devices.svg" alt="Diagram illustrating the components considered for the cybersecurity of medical devices." loading="lazy" width="800" height="566" />
    <figcaption>Cybersecurity considerations for the design and manufacturing of medical devices</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Cybersecurity must be integrated into every stage of a medical device’s lifecycle. Annex I of the MDR and IVDR highlights several critical aspects of secure design and manufacture:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Risks must be identified, assessed, and managed throughout the device’s lifecycle (sections 3, 14.4, 14.5, 19.3).</li>
    <li><strong>Protection Against Risks:</strong> Devices must be designed to protect against risks during both intended use and foreseeable misuse (sections 3c, 8).</li>
    <li><strong>Unauthorised Access:</strong> Measures must be in place to prevent unauthorised access to the device and its data (sections 17.4, 18.8).</li>
    <li><strong>Threats and Vulnerabilities:</strong> Manufacturers must identify and address security threats, vulnerabilities, and risks (section 4b).</li>
    <li><strong>Risk Control Measures:</strong> Effective risk control measures must be established to mitigate identified risks (section 4).</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum IT Security Requirements:</strong> Devices must meet minimum IT security standards to ensure baseline protection (sections 17.4, 14.5).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A key driver of secure design and manufacturing is the <strong>state of the art</strong> (sections 1, 4, 17.2). Manufacturers should consider the state of the art when designing developing and upgrading medical devices across their life cycle. This involves incorporating the latest advancements, technologies, and best practices into their decision-making processes to address security risks proportionally and appropriately. By aligning with the state of the art, manufacturers can ensure that their devices are not only compliant with regulatory requirements but also resilient against emerging threats, safeguarding patient safety and data security over the long term.</p>
  <h3 id="how-are-the-cybersecurity-requirements-under-mdr-interrelated-to-the-other-relevant-eu-legislations-cybersecurity-act-gdpr-and-nis">How are the cybersecurity requirements under MDR interrelated to the other relevant EU legislations (Cybersecurity Act, GDPR and NIS)?</h3>
  <p>Cybersecurity requirements under the MDR are interconnected with other EU legislations, such as the Cybersecurity Act, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive. While the EU MDR and IVDR focus on the safety and performance of medical devices, these additional legislations address broader aspects of cybersecurity, data protection, and network security. The <a href="https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/download/b23b362f-8a56-434c-922a-5b3ca4d0a7a1_en">MDCG 2019-16 Rev 1</a> guidance provides a detailed discussion of how these requirements overlap and complement each other.</p>
  <h3 id="what-cybersecurity-activities-does-the-manufacturer-need-to-carry-out-during-the-lifecycle-of-a-medical-device-according-to-mdr">What cybersecurity activities does the manufacturer need to carry out during the lifecycle of a medical device according to MDR?</h3>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/applying-unique-device-identifier-step-by-step-guide-mantrasystems-v7dqe/">Unique Device Identifier (UDI)</a> is a crucial element in the medical device industry, designed to enhance the traceability and safety of medical devices. Think of UDI as a sort of “digital fingerprint” for each device—a unique combination of numbers and codes that provide important details about the device, such as its model, manufacturing batch, and more. It’s like putting a <em>superpower</em> into your device packaging, empowering manufacturers, regulators, and healthcare providers to quickly identify and track a device.</p>
  <p>A UDI is made up of two core components:</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/content/articles/inline/breaking-down-the-udi.svg" alt="Diagram illustrating the UDI-DI vs UDI-PI split." loading="lazy" width="840" height="290" />
  </figure>
  <h3 id="1-udi-di-device-identifier">1. UDI-DI (Device Identifier)</h3>
  <p>This is the fixed portion of the UDI and uniquely identifies the model or version of the device. It’s used to identify the product at a high level, no matter where it is sold or used. The UDI-DI is assigned by the manufacturer and remains constant across all units of that particular device.</p>
  <h3 id="2-udi-pi-production-identifier">2. UDI-PI (Production Identifier)</h3>
  <p>The variable portion of the UDI includes critical details about the device, such as its serial number, lot number, expiry date, or manufacture date. This part of the UDI ensures the traceability of each individual unit, making it easy to track and manage the device throughout its lifecycle.</p>
  <h2 id="whats-the-udi-carrier">What’s the UDI Carrier?</h2>
  <p>The UDI carrier is the machine-readable version of the UDI that is placed on the label or packaging of the medical device. It’s typically a barcode or QR code—something that can be quickly scanned by healthcare providers, distributors, or anyone handling the device. UDI carriers make tracking the device in real-time much more efficient.</p>
  <p>There are two common forms of UDI carriers:</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/content/articles/inline/which-udi-carrier.svg" alt="Diagram showing which UDI carrier should be used for medical devices?" loading="lazy" width="744" height="309" />
  </figure>
  <p>In accordance with Annex VI, Part C, Section 4.1, the UDI Carrier – both the Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) and the Human Readable Interpretation (HRI) must be placed on the label, the device itself, and all higher packaging levels. However, Section 4.2 allows the UDI carrier to be placed on the next higher packaging level if space on the unit of use packaging is limited. Additionally, Section 4.3 states that for single-use devices of Classes I and IIa, the UDI carrier is not required on the individual packaging but must appear on the next higher packaging level (e.g., a carton containing multiple devices).</p>
  <h2 id="understanding-udi-and-eudamed">Understanding UDI and EUDAMED</h2>
  <p>Under the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/745/oj/eng">EU MDR 2017/745</a>, medical device manufacturers must submit UDI data to <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/eudamed">EUDAMED</a> for all devices that fall under the regulation. Here’s how UDI submission fits into EUDAMED:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Manufacturers must submit UDI-DI information for each product (or product model) to EUDAMED to ensure that it is tracked in the European market.</li>
    <li>UDI-DI Data: This includes the unique identifier for each device, along with essential details such as the device’s name, model, classification, and the manufacturer’s information.</li>
    <li>EUDAMED Registration: Manufacturers must first register in EUDAMED to begin submitting UDI-DI information. Only those devices that are subject to MDR or IVDR are required to be listed in EUDAMED.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="udi-format-explained">UDI Format Explained</h2>
  <p>In the HRI format, you can see the UDI-DI, which is the number after the (01). Each time you see the 01 between brackets, this means this is the placeholder for the UDI-DI.</p>
  <p>Then, we arrive at the UDI-PI part. As mentioned, this part can vary depending on the production characteristic of the product.</p>
  <p>You can identify some numbers in the bracket on the UDI-PI part. Let’s decode them. Each of these numbers provides specific information about the product:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>(10) is for the lot number</li>
    <li>(11) is for the production date</li>
    <li>(17) defines the expiration date</li>
    <li>(21) is the serial number.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example: (01)00827002005112­(17)000004(10)­1234(21)8234</strong></p>
  <p>All this information is dynamic and will have to change each time you have a new batch or a new expiry date.</p>
  <h2 id="the-basic-udi-di">The Basic UDI-DI</h2>
  <p>The Basic UDI-DI is an EU approach for linking devices to their regulatory documentation and it is intended to uniquely identify the product model throughout the entire life cycle of the product.</p>
  <p>The Basic UDI-DI is a primary identifier of a device model i.e. it connects devices with the same intended purpose, risk class, and essential design and manufacturing characteristics. It is also the main record key in the UDI database i.e. it connects all associated UDI-DIs in the UDI database with the information in other EUDAMED modules.</p>
  <p>You’ll have it on your:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Certificates (Notified Bodies)</li>
    <li>Declaration of conformity</li>
    <li>Technical Documentation</li>
    <li>Summary of safety and clinical performance</li>
    <li>Certificate of free sale (Article 60(1) of MDR)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This one does not appear on the packaging of the products. It’s really an invisible number for your customers and is used solely in administration.</p>
  <h2 id="decoding-udi-strategic-takeaways">Decoding UDI: Strategic Takeaways</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, understanding and implementing the Unique Device Identifier (UDI) system is crucial for ensuring the safety, traceability, and regulatory compliance of medical devices. By breaking down the components of UDI, such as the UDI-DI, UDI-PI, and their formats (AIDC and HRI), manufacturers can streamline their processes and meet both EU and global regulatory requirements.</p>
  <p>With the correct application of UDI, medical device manufacturers enhance transparency, facilitate recalls, and ultimately contribute to better patient safety and device management in healthcare systems worldwide.</p>

To ensure compliance, manufacturers must thoroughly understand the classification rules outlined in Annex VIII of the IVDR.</p>
  <h2 id="what-has-changed">What has changed?</h2>
  <p>A significant change for manufacturers with the <a href="/articles/ivdd-ivdr-ensuring-compliance-during-transitional-period">transition from IVDD 98/79/EC to EU IVDR 2017/746</a> is the shift in classification of <em>in vitro</em> diagnostic medical devices from a “list-based” system to a “risk-based” approach.</p>
  <p>Under the IVDD, devices were categorized into List A and List B based on specific medical conditions. Devices on these lists required Notified Body submission, while all others were considered self-certifiable.</p>
  <p>In alignment with EU MDR, classification of <em>in vitro</em> diagnostic medical devices is now risk-based and moves through a system of class A, B, C and D. This classification considers both patient risk and broader public health implications. To achieve this, the IVDR makes use of 10 implementation rules and 7 classification rules to classify <em>in vitro</em> medical devices (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/746/oj/eng#anx_VIII">Annex VIII IVDR</a>).</p>
  <h2 id="risk-categories-explained">Risk categories explained</h2>
  <p>The risk of <em>in vitro</em> diagnostic medical devices is assessed based on the potential consequences of an incorrect result or diagnosis.</p>
  <p>Class A is the lowest risk category. It includes general laboratory devices, instruments and specimen receptacles. Non-sterile Class A devices can self-certify for a CE mark, meaning that they do not have to complete the process of conformity through a Notified Body.</p>
  <p>Class B risk category is the default class for all <em>in vitro</em> medical devices which are not covered specifically by other classification rules. It covers devices which are considered to be lower risk to patients and to the wider population. Examples include self-testing devices for pregnancy and fertility, self-testing kits for blood cholesterol or glucose levels, and urine tests for white or red blood cells, or bacteria.</p>
  <p>Class C includes IVDs that pose a lower risk to the wider population but a higher risk to the patient if the test result is inaccurate. In these cases, a diagnostic failure could have life-threatening consequences, such as in tests for infectious diseases or cancer. This class also covers companion diagnostics and genetic screening. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-companion-diagnostics-what-you-need-know-iyche/">Companion diagnostics</a> are IVDs which provide information which is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug or biological product.</p>
  <p>The highest risk classification is Class D. This class includes IVDs which test for general life-threatening conditions, and more specifically, for highly transmissible infectious agents in blood and biological material, which may be transplanted or readministered into the body. These transmissible agents may also present a high risk to the wider population. Class D also includes IVDs for blood grouping and tissue typing.</p>
  <h2 id="consequences-of-the-new-classification-rules">Consequences of the new classification rules</h2>
  <p>A major impact of the new risk classification system under IVDR is that approximately 78% of IVDs now require Notified Body certification, a significant increase from just 8% under the previous IVDD1. Initially there was a backlog in conformity assessments due to the low number of IVDR designated NBs. However, that has been rectified to some extent, with 12 notified bodies designated for IVDR submissions as of October 2024.</p>
  <p>Results from a recent Notified Body survey2 on certifications and applications, performed by the European Commission, found that one of the primary reasons for IVDR application refusals of IVDR applications was “wrong qualification/classification of device”. This highlights the importance of understanding and implementing the classification rules of Annex VII of the IVDR prior to the production of the technical file.</p>
