              <h2 id="what-is-an-mdr-clinical-evaluation-plan">What is an MDR Clinical Evaluation Plan?</h2>
              <p>An MDR Clinical Evaluation Plan is a documented plan for performing Clinical Evaluation of a medical device under the MDR. Clinical Evaluation is a systematic process to assess the safety and performance of a medical device that must be planned in advance and conducted according to the documented plan.</p>
              <p>The objective of clinical evaluation under the MDR is to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>demonstrate conformity with the relevant MDR Annex I General Safety and Performance Requirements (SPRs), and</li>
                <li>to prove that the device’s benefit-risk profile continues to be acceptable.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In simple terms, clinical evaluation answers the question “does this medical device work as intended, and is it safe?” through the constant production, assessment and systematic analysis of clinical evidence.</p>
              <p>An MDR Clinical Evaluation plan outlines how the process of Clinical Evaluation will be fed by information from multiple sources and processes. Clinical Evaluation can be thought of as a ‘bringing together’ of clinical data accumulated through systematic literature reviews, post market surveillance (PMS), post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) and vigilance systems, as well as conclusions drawn from risk management and quality management processes.</p>
              <h2 id="how-has-the-eu-mdr-changed-the-process-of-producing-a-clinical-evaluation-plan">How has the EU MDR changed the process of producing a Clinical Evaluation Plan?</h2>
              <p>In May 2021 the new Medical Device Regulations (MDR) (EU) 2017/745 will be fully in force. The MDR replaces the Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC (MDD) and represents a significant overhaul of all aspects of medical device regulation. All medical devices and medical device manufacturers within the EU will need to comply with the new MDR regulations in order to trade and sell in the EU market.</p>
              <p>As a consequence of the enhanced requirements imposed by the MDR, many existing medical device clinical evaluation processes may fail to meet the required standard, even if they successfully met expectations under the MDD.</p>
              <p>The MDR lists a number of requirements for medical device clinical evaluation in Annex XIV Part A which all have a bearing on producing a Clinical Evaluation Plan. Specific changes to clinical evaluation introduced by the MDR include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Replacing the MDD Essential Requirements with the MDR Annex I General Safety and Performance Requirements (SPRs). The SPRs are more extensive and specific than the Essential Requirements, and raise the required evidence burden for manufacturers.</li>
                <li>Thoroughly overhauling rules on equivalence, making it much more difficult for manufacturers to successfully claim equivalence under the MDR. In many cases, manufacturers who previously claimed equivalence will need to completely re-engineer the clinical evaluation for their devices.</li>
                <li>Assigning a new risk classification to some devices, increasing the complexity of clinical evaluation required for devices that have been allocated a higher risk category.</li>
                <li>Introducing new requirements for PMCF, detailed in MDR Annex XIV Part B, that require manufacturers to establish more robust PMCF systems and include outputs of PMCF into the clinical evaluation for each device.</li>
                <li>Mandating a higher level of detail and structure in Clinical Evaluation Reports (CERs) that periodically summarise the clinical evaluation of each medical device.</li>
                <li>Requiring clinical evaluation to account for the full scope of a medical device’s lifecycle, from initial realisation and design, through construction and manufacturing to marketing post-market surveillance and senescence.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2 id="how-is-an-mdr-clinical-evaluation-plan-produced">How is an MDR Clinical Evaluation Plan produced?</h2>
              <p>Guidance on how to produce a Clinical Evaluation Plan can be found in MDR Annex XIV Part A. The Annex requires that manufacturers:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>establish and regularly update a clinical evaluation plan</li>
                <li>identify available clinical data relevant to the device</li>
                <li>identify any gaps in clinical evidence through a systematic scientific literature review</li>
                <li>appraise all relevant clinical data by evaluating suitability for establishing safety and performance</li>
                <li>generate any necessary new or additional clinical data required in order to address any identified gaps</li>
                <li>analyse all relevant clinical data in order to reach conclusions about the safety and performance of the device</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In addition to information in Annex XIV Part A, further guidance on producing a clinical evaluation plan can be obtained from MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev 4, one of a series of advisory documents published by the European Commission. It is important to be aware that MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev 4 has yet to be updated to reflect changes introduced by the MDR.</p>
              <p>Developing a medical device Clinical Evaluation Plan is a complex process requiring a high degree of clinical and regulatory expertise. Mantra Systems offers the opportunity for you to benefit from the expertise of our team of specially-trained medical professionals, bringing their clinical knowledge and acumen to your MDR clinical evaluation. Contact us today to discuss your requirements.</p>
              <h2 id="what-happens-after-a-clinical-evaluation-plan-has-been-developed">What happens after a Clinical Evaluation Plan has been developed?</h2>
              <p>After a Clinical Evaluation Plan has been developed, the continuous process of Clinical Evaluation is carried out in accordance with the plan. Periodically, the results of clinical evaluation must be summarised in a technical document known as a Clinical Evaluation Report (CER). The CER must be an extensive summary of the findings of clinical evaluation, written objectively and carefully structured. Writing a CER is a demanding, technical task that requires a high level of regulatory expertise and clinical acumen.</p>
              <p>MEDDEV 2.7/1 contains guidance on structuring a CER but has not been updated to reflect changes introduced by the MDR.</p>
              <p>At Mantra Systems, we have a team of expertly-trained medical doctors who are specialists at developing clinical evaluation plans, performing medical device clinical evaluations and writing CERs for the EU MDR. Because a Clinical Evaluation is such a central component of the regulatory process for every medical device, engaging the services of a medical expert who understands EU MDR requirements in detail can be a major step towards ensuring a successful MDR transition.</p>
